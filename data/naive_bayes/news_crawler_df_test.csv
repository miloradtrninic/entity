5e8e10cf2bfd715ed112e31b	Dow ends 770 points higher as investors eye re-opening of economy, more Fed support	U.S. stocks finished sharply higher Wednesday as investors hoped for more Federal Reserve support and a potential sooner-than-expected rollback of containment measures put in place to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Bernie Sanders also ended his race for the White House, removing market uncertainty around his campaign promises to rein in Wall Street and big corporations as president. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +3.44% rose 779.71 points, or 3.4%, to finish at 23,433.57. The S&P 500 index SPX, +3.40% added 90.57 points, or 3.4%, to end at 2,749.98, and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +2.58% climbed 203.64 points, or 2.6%, to close at 8,090.90. On Tuesday, the blue-chip Dow DJIA, +3.44% lost 26.13 points, or 0.1%, to finish at 22,653.86, the S&P 500 index SPX, +3.40% shed 4.27 points, or 0.2%, to end at 2,659.41, and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +2.58% fell 25.98 points, or 0.3%, closing at 7,887.26. The Dow is now 20.7% off its record close in February, while the S&P 500 is off 18.8% and the Nasdaq off 17.6%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The White House’s plans for reopening the U.S. economy and an account of the Federal Reserve’s emergency actions taken last month were points of focus for investors. Minutes for the central bank’s March 15 policy meeting showed that staffers viewed no major economic recovery until next year as a worst-case scenario of the coronavirus outbreak, according to minutes released Wednesday. Fed staffers also fretted about a lack of future ammunition to combat economic distress after the central bank took unprecedented monetary-policy actions last month and slashed rates to a range of 0% to 0.25%. Following the minutes’ release, Bob Miller, head of Americas fundamental fixed-income at BlackRock, estimated that the Fed’s “do-whatever-it-takes attitude” could swell the central bank’s balance sheet to $10 trillion in the coming year, as the Fed looks to forge a pathway to recovery. Stocks also rose after Sanders exited the U.S. presidential race on Wednesday, opening the way for Joe Biden to become the Democratic nominee. Sanders’ candidacy has kept investors on edge over the past few months over concerns that his hostility to corporations and plans for universal health coverage could lead to increased regulatory costs and lower earnings growth. “On the margin, having no longer any possibility of a progressive in the White House, that’s helped,” said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust, in an interview with MarketWatch. This comes as Trump administration officials have expressed a desire to begin to reopen parts of the economy that have been shut to help limit the spread of the viral contagion that has ravaged the globe. When and what form that process takes place may be key to helping investors anticipate the economic rebound ahead. “This week, we’re starting to see folks shift to being more hopeful that maybe the social distancing measures can be relieved sooner rather than later,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, in an interview. But Dr. Anthony Fauci, the expert in infectious diseases and face of the response to COVID-19 on President Donald Trump’s pandemic task force, said a path isn’t clear. “It isn’t like a light switch on and off,” he said in a podcast interview with the Wall Street Journal that aired on Tuesday. The total death toll in the U.S. from the pandemic rose sharply to more than 12,900, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Confirmed infections in the U.S. neared 400,000, more than double the number of any other nation. Cases globally rose to more than 1.4 million, while deaths exceeded 85,000. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the number of deaths exceeded 6,200 and warned that fatalities will continue to rise as more patients lose their battle with the virus. “The bad news isn’t just bad. The bad news is terrible,” Cuomo said in his daily news briefing. Pimco’s U.S. economist Tiffany Wilding warned that of the value of U.S. goods and services could plunge to negative 30% in the second quarter, while unemployment could temporarily top 20% due to the pandemic. “Ultimately, we think the government and the central bank will do whatever it takes to limit the longer-term damage to the U.S. economy, and that the virus outbreak will eventually subside,” Wilding wrote in a blog post Wednesday. “However, in the meantime there will be some business bankruptcies and lost GDP.” Separately, U.S. exchanges on Friday will be closed in observance of Good Friday, and those in Europe will also be closed for Easter Monday. The Passover holiday also starts Wednesday evening, which may result in lower volumes on Wall Street. Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +4.49% said Wednesday that it has decided to maintain its quarterly dividend of $1.03 a share, with the next dividend payable May 20 to shareholders of record on April 20. Shares finished 4.5% higher. Marathon Oil Corp. MRO, +7.33% shares advanced 7.3% after it announced a further cut to this year’s capital expenditures budget to $1.3 billion, half of what it spent in 2019. Energy companies have attempted to conserve cash amid worries that many would default in a backdrop of depressed crude prices. Spirit Aerosystems Holdings Inc. SPR, +16.01% is taking a series of measures to cut costs afterBoeing Co. BA, +3.73% suspended all deliveries to its Washington state and South Carolina facilities until further notice. The company laid off 2,800 workers in its Wichita, Kansas, operations. Shares of Spirit gained 16%. Nordstrom Inc. shares JWN, +5.32% rose 5.3% after it said it had temporarily closed all physical stores and had furloughed most of the workers. General Motors Co. GM, +8.59% said Wednesday it is contracted to make 30,000 ventilators, at a price of $489.4 million, for the Strategic National Stockpile by the end of August. Shares added 8.6%. Shares of FedEx Corp. FDX, +8.27% and United Parcel Service Inc. UPS, +6.32% rose after The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.56% was halting its competing Amazon Shipping delivery service. In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.746% rose 2.7 basis points to 0.762%. U.S. oil prices closed higher, with the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery CLK20, +2.51% gaining $1.46, or 6.2%, to settle at $25.09 a barrel. In precious metals, the price of an ounce of gold for June delivery GCM20, -0.04% tacked on 60 cents, or 0.04%, to settle at $1,684.30 an ounce. The U.S. dollar was up 0.2% relative to a basket of trading peers, gauged by the ICE U.S. Dollar DXY, -0.02%. In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, +0.01% finished 0.2% higher on Wednesday.

5e750553cde7595dfaf4a044	Dollar rampage spurs FX interventions, speculation of big G7 move	(This March 19 story corrects March 19 version of the story to fix dollar gain in paragraph 4) By Karin Strohecker and Sujata Rao LONDON (Reuters) - From Brazil to Norway, policymakers are leaping to defend currencies against the onslaught of the dollar which scaled three-year peaks on Thursday, raising speculation that a joint move by the world’s biggest central banks may be in the offing. Unlikely, most market-watchers say. But these are unusual times, and Norway’s central bank earlier in the day threatened to intervene to lift the crown, a step it hasn’t taken in more than 20 years. The warning followed the crown’s 30% plunge versus the dollar in less than three weeks, though oil’s price collapse contributed. But the dollar’s brutal ascent — up 5% this month against a basket of peers — has sent almost every other currency reeling. Amid the crisis caused by worries about how badly the coronavirus pandemic will hit the world economy, investors and companies around the world have been scrambling to get their hands on the market’s most liquid currency. That forced highly unexpected moves such as a 15 basis-point rate rise from Denmark to support its crown while other countries such as Russia and Brazil engaged in direct dollar-buying. And South Africa said it did not rule out emergency interventions. Despite these efforts, a global stampede for dollar funding meant currencies across the world sank to multi-year or record lows against the greenback. Some relief came after the U.S. Federal Reserve opened $450 billion in swap lines to several central banks but the pressure broadly remains. “If there is one currency causing problems right now and aggravating the sell-off in global asset markets, it is the U.S. dollar,” ING Bank told clients. Could the answer lie in large-scale global intervention to tame the greenback? Most top central banks, with the exception perhaps of Switzerland, are committed to letting markets determine exchange rates. Yet many welcomed Norway’s shift; Danske Bank economist Frank Jullum urged it to buy crowns “by the bucketful”. One issue is that piecemeal central bank interventions are often doomed to fail as individual economies usually lack the firepower to influence currency markets for any length of time But shock-and-awe moves such as the coordinated Group of Seven moves to weaken the yen, seen after the 9/11 terror attacks or the 2011 Japan tsunami, have worked. Alternatively the United States could act alone, some say, noting that dollar strength was highly unwelcome at a time when the U.S. economy is headed for recession. The last time the Fed went out on its own was in the early 1990s under George H.W. Bush to stem a soaring dollar. “The U.S. has brought in almost all its instruments, the one that hasn’t been done is intervention - the stronger the dollar gets the more likely the U.S. government will consider intervening,” said Thomas Flury, head of FX strategies at UBS Global Wealth Management’s Chief Investment Office. “Typical during past crises, FX interventions helped calm not only FX markets but also equities and brought credit spreads down and that is something they will be keen to do.” (GRAPHIC: U.S. Treasury daily FX interventions - here) Dollar strength will dismay not only those in the Trump administration, but others around the world because when the dollar rises, it tends to ‘tighten’ conditions through channels such as higher import prices or by forcing interest rate hikes to shield currencies. That in turn risks triggering a full-blown emerging markets crisis, the pattern seen many times in the 20th century. Its power is down to the outsize role it plays in keeping the world’s financial systems ticking over, accounting for 40% of global trade flows, 50% of cross-border lending and 65-85% of the world’s risk-free assets, according to Goldman Sachs. “Dollar strength is unwelcome for the U.S. as it tightens financial conditions but for the rest of world it tightens financial conditions even more because many countries are highly dollarised or they have dollar debt,” said Claire Dissaux, head of global economics & strategy at Millennium Global Investments. She doubts so far the pain from the dollar is big enough for Washington to ponder intervention — alone or with G7 peers — and says containing the raging selloff in equity markets will be the greater focus. Plus there are the logistics of coordinating such a move with other central banks, many of which will not be keen to see their own currencies strengthening even as world growth nosedives. Without “credible commitment from a group of central banks it won’t work,” said Dissaux who believes the best option is more swap lines of the sort the Fed announced on Thursday But it is not just the dollar rise that is hurting, but also the brutal volatility. Implied volatility, or expected price swings for some of the world’s biggest currencies have rocketed to multi-year highs — one-month Norwegian crown vol is over 30%, triple end-February levels. The euro, pound and all emerging market currencies paint a similar picture. “The vols are unbelievable. Intervention would quickly kick that lower,” Flury of UBS Wealth said, calling it “the fear factor”.

5e86278e76742046e3b93666	Brace for the ‘deepest recession on record,’ says BofA analysts, as jobless claims surge to 6.6 million	There are no parallels for the pandemic fueled slowdown that the U.S. economy is currently contending with, and that is forcing economists like those of Bank of America Global Research to forecast a decidedly grimmer outlook for the American economy than they offered just two weeks ago. The BofA researchers on Thursday said the coming recession “appears to be deeper and more prolonged than we were led to believe just 14 days ago when we last updated our forecasts, not just in the US but globally as well.” The April 2 research report, which includes star economist Michelle Meyer, comes as the number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits last week soared by a record 6.6 million, bringing the increase in new jobless claims in the last two weeks of March to 10 million. As MarketWatch reports the scale of the shutdowns of business in force, intended to help mitigate the spread of the deadly pathogen, is unprecedented and is having a substantial negative impact on the labor market and the broader economy. To that end, BofA sees between 16 and 20 million job losses, which could send the unemployment rate, which stands at 3.5% as of February’s report, surging within a few months to 15.6%, which would by far outstrip the unemployment rate during the 2007-09 recession. A report on U.S. nonfarm payrolls will be released on Friday, but isn’t likely to show the full extent of the labor-market damage because of when that data was recorded, just before the worst of the coronavirus outbreak. The BofA team forecast three consecutive quarters of contraction in gross domestic product, “with the US economy shrinking 7% (annualized) in 1Q, 30% in 2Q and 1% in 3Q.” On the bright side, the economists estimate that the fourth quarter of 2020 will see a sizable pop in business activity as the measures put in place to slow the deadly contagion are slowly unwound. That said, the cumulative decline in economic expansion will be severe: “We forecast the cumulative decline in GDP to be 10.4% and this will be the deepest recession on record, nearly five times more severe than the post-war average,” the analysts wrote. Why are the researchers predicting “a recession unlike any other,” as they describe in their report, despite the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented efforts to loosen seized-up areas of the financial market and a limitless bond-buying program as well as a $2.28 trillion relief package that was signed into law on Friday by President Donald Trump? The analysts say that while they expect the consumer spending to eventually return, turning positive in the third quarter, they anticipate “further contraction in business and residential investment.” “We also think there will be additional inventory contraction given impaired supply chains and frictions in production,” BofA wrote. While consumer spending will likely turn positive in 3Q as the economy slowly opens, they still see weakness in the consumer “as they face job cuts and a significant negative wealth shock,” they wrote “This naturally leads to more cautious behavior,” the analysts said. Equity markets, meanwhile, have been struggling to process the outlook for the economy. On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.48%, the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.37% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.25% were all set to open with losses. World-wide infections of COVID-19, which was first identified in Wuhan, China in December, are nearing one million and more than 48,000 lives have been claimed, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. Late Tuesday, President Donald Trump warned that the U.S. faced a “very, very painful” two weeks while the White House projected between 100,000 to 240,000 U.S. deaths from the illness. The U.S. labor market showed further signs of damage from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 on Friday as the global case tally continued to extend beyond a million and the death toll passed 54,000.

5e6eacdb3efb433fca7503c3	U.S. dollar drops after Fed cuts rates to near zero, launches other moves	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell late on Sunday after the Federal Reserve unleashed a series of moves to stem the global fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, led by a cut in U.S. interest rates to zero percent, the second rate cut in less than two weeks. In a statement, the Fed said it reduced the federal funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25%. The Fed, along with five other major foreign central banks, also cut pricing on their swap lines to make it easier to provide dollars to their financial institutions facing stress in credit markets. The U.S. central bank also said it would expand its balance sheet by at least $700 billion in coming weeks The Fed, the Bank of Canada, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Japan and Swiss National Bank set up swap lines in the financial crisis. “Clearly the Fed feels that what the governments are doing are inadequate and not enough. So they’re throwing everything they can at this situation,” said Juan Perez, senior currency trader at Tempus Inc. In Washington. “But it’s going to be really volatile when markets open. The dollar will swing wildly. We’ll just have to see.” In late Sunday trading, the dollar fell 1.2% against the yen to 106.71 yen JPY=EBS, while the euro rose 0.7% to $1.1190 EUR=. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was down 0.6% to 0.9447 franc CHF=. The overall dollar index was down 0.7% at 97.733 =USD.

5e81b5e9c496d2354de73021	March 18-22: Central Bank Decisions	Main central banks: FOMC The U.S Fed surprised everyone by signaling it will not raise rates again in 2019, stating that U.S economic growth has slowed. Fed officials also said they would end the drawdown of central bank bond holdings in September, a tad later than the market had expected. Fed Chair Powell said in a press conference that “it may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation calls clearly for a change in policy.” It was a much more ‘dovish’ outcome than the street expected. With inflation low and stable, similar to other G10 central banks, there is no stress to do anything, and the FOMC members are united. The committee slashed its economic forecast to +2.1% for 2019 from +2.3% and +1.9% for 2020 from +2%. Slowing growth in Europe and China, worries over tariffs and past rate hikes are beginning to have an impact. Bank of England (BoE) The Bank of England (BoE) held its benchmark interest rate steady and said it still expects to begin gently nudging up borrowing costs if the U.K’s exit from the E.U goes smoothly, even as other G7 change course amid signs the global economy is losing steam. The MPC agreed 9-0 to leave the central bank’s main policy rate at +0.75% and the size of its bond portfolio unchanged at +£435B. Governor Carney has indicated that mounting inflationary pressure and a healthy labor market mean it expects to gently raise interest rates over the next two to three years if Britain’s EU exit goes smoothly. In the case of a Brexit deal or a long extension, the consensus believes a summer rate hike is a possibility. The BoE staff now see the economy carrying more momentum and expect it to grow by +0.3% in Q1, up from +0.2% contained in the February Inflation Report. However, the possibility of a “no deal,” whose odds have shortened this week, could require the BoE to looking at easing policy. Swiss National Bank (SNB) The Swiss National Bank (SNB) kept its deposit rate at -0.75% as widely expected. Notably, it reduced its inflation forecasts for 2019 and 2020 to +0.3% and +0.6%, respectively, suggesting no end in sight to negative interest rates. Norway’s central Bank (Norges Bank) The outlier, Norway’s Norges bank, who bucked the trend among the major central banks by raising its key interest rate by +0.25% to +1.0% and flagging another increase before year-end. As western Europe’s biggest oil exporter, Norway is letting a rebound in crude prices steer monetary policy. “Our current assessment of the outlook and balance of risks suggests that the policy rate will most likely be increased further in the course of the next half-year,” central bank Governor Oystein Olsen said in a statement on Thursday. Other central banks: Bank of Thailand (BoT) The benchmark interest rate was kept at +1.75% for a second consecutive meeting. The decision was unanimous. Assistant Governor Titanun Mallikamas spoke of “many uncertainties within and outside the country.” For one, the nation goes to elections on March 24 and then there are risks from a global slowdown. Officials also lowered the outlook for economic growth this year to +3.8% from +4%, while there was no change to the headline inflation forecast for 2019. Central Bank of Iceland The Central Bank of Iceland kept their key interest rate steady at +4.5%. Governor Mar Gudmundsson stated that recent indicators of economic activity and the labour market suggest that demand pressures in the economy continue to subside. He says inflation is still likely to rise somewhat over most of the year, however, although actual developments will depend on the results of the ongoing wage negotiations. Also, the MPC reiterated that it has “both the will and the tools necessary to keep inflation and inflation expectations at target over the long term.” Morocco Bank Al Maghrib Morocco’s central bank kept interest rates unchanged at a record low of +2.25%, despite slashing 2019 projections for inflation and economic growth. Morocco is experiencing its first spell of deflation as Africa’s second-biggest energy importer in more than 12-months. Central bank of Argentina (BCRA) Argentina raised its monetary policy rate by +101 bps to +64.885% this week. Argentina has increased its short-term rate by over +20% since mid-February to stabilize the peso. Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) As widely expected, the Copom (MPC) held the Selic at +6.5%. Policy makers now view the balance of risks to inflation as ‘neutral.’ They also toned down their assessment of recent economic activity, which “came in below expectations,” while acknowledging “a gradual recovery path.” However, officials mentioned the need to evaluate the economy with no shocks and less uncertainty, an assessment that “should not be completed in the short run.” Indonesia central bank (BI) BI left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for a fourth consecutive month as the Fed shifts to a prolonged pause gives policy makers in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy room to support growth. The seven-day reverse repurchase rate was left at +6% as expected. Governor Warjiyoand has raised the rate by a total of +175 bps over the last year to “ward off a market rout in developing economies and a slump in the currency, triggered by a tighter Fed monetary policy.” Bank Indonesia remains cautious though, given concerns about the current-account deficit and the economy’s vulnerability to currency swings. Philippine central bank (BSP) BSP left its benchmark interest rate unchanged in Governor Diokno’s first policy meeting, as officials remained cautious even as inflation eases. They held the overnight reverse repurchase rate at +4.75%, in line with expectations. Inflation forecasts for this year and next were little changed at +3%. Governor Diokno took office this month and has indicated his willingness to cut rates or reduce the reserve ratio for banks. Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) The CBC kept the discount rate unchanged at +1.375% as expected. Preview: Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) The CBR is expected to hold rates steady on Friday (Mar 22), with the market instead watching closely for any hint from Governor Nabiullina that the inflation danger from a recent tax hike is over, paving the way for monetary easing. The CBR provided two surprise rate hikes late last year, however, with a spike in inflation likely to be softer than expected, the consensus has switched their bets from another hike to a cut before the end of 2019. Colombia central bank (Banrep) Market consensus expects Colombia’s central bank to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at +4.25% when it meets March 22.

5e7aca96a5feb43cae9ed869	US Dollar May Fall if S&P 500 Rises on Short Bets, USD/CAD Eyes Support	In this week’s session, I discussed the outlook for the US Dollar given rising hopes of local fiscal stimulus. That helped bring the largest single-day gain in the Dow Jones since 1933. The cautious improvement in sentiment is weighing against the haven-linked Greenback for the time being. There may be scope for near term losses after my majors-based USD index took out “inner” support on the chart below. Down the road if “outer” support holds, the dominant uptrend could remain intact. From here, what is the outlook given signals in trader positioning on Wall Street and thereby the Dollar? USD Index Chart Created in Trading View According to IG Client Sentiment, about 50.28% of traders are net long the S&P 500 at the time of writing. This is after a 23.5% and 27.92% increase in short bets over a daily and weekly basis respectively. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current price trend may soon reverse higher despite the fact traders remain netlong. That may speak to investors attempting to pick the next top in the S&P 500. From a technical standpoint, S&P 500 futures managed to close above “inner” resistance on the 4-hour chart below. Further upside confirmation may extend the recent bottom as prices aim towards “outer” resistance. The latter may maintain the dominant downtrend since topping in late February. Prices are also nervously testing rising support from 2009. Resuming losses entails taking out support at 2174. S&P 500 Futures Chart Created in Trading View IG Client Sentiment shows that about 25.29% of retail traders are net long USD/CAD at the time of writing. Net-short positioning is on the rise, up 9.01% and 10.64% over a daily and weekly basis respectively. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes offers a stronger USD/CAD-bullish contrarian trading bias. From a psychological standpoint, that would speak to more investors attempting to pick the top. USD/CAD continues to trade sideways under highs from 2016, making for a key range of resistance between 1.4576 to 1.4690. Maintaining the upward trajectory are two levels of support, “outer” and “inner” below. Taking out the former may pave the way to test the latter which could down the road bring declines to a pause. Resuming the uptrend entails taking out 2016 peaks.

5e7d07c61b8d7916be4df000	Dow, S&P 500 Hasten Rally as the USD Snaps - Is the Low in Place?	A bit of hope is holding on as the risk trade has come back to life this week. Despite another nasty open to the week the S&P 500 has held on to Tuesday’s gains and even added some more on Wednesday and, so far in Thursday trade. This happens even as US jobless claims printed in a shocking manner, with 3.2 million printing against the prior week’s 281k. But – as with everything else in financial markets, context is important; and this shockingly negative print was at least somewhat offset when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin noted that it wasn’t relevant given everything else that the Fed and now Congress have done in the effort of addressing the ongoing issues from a coronavirus-fueled slowdown. So, at this point, given that there’s been a few days’ worth of gains strung together – the big question is whether the low has yet been put in or whether we’re at a temporary impasse in a longer-term or bigger picture sell-off. And there’s really motive on either side of the scenario: From the angle of fear, we likely haven’t yet seen the worst from the novel coronavirus and many estimates are suggesting that the ‘peak’ is at least weeks away. On the other, both the Fed and Congress have come together with economic stimulus the likes of which the world has never seen. What can be appropriate for the trader or investor at this point is to identify areas of strength or promise for either scenario. As looked at in Tuesday and again in today’s webinar, the Nasdaq 100 has held up respectably, all factors considered. My colleague, Peter Hanks, discussed this a little earlier today. The Dow, meanwhile, has been hit especially hard as a major constituent of the index (Boeing) is battling multiple negative drivers. At this point, the Dow has started to test resistance at an interesting spot on the chart. The price of 22,420 is the 50% marker from the 2016-2020 major move; and this is from the same Fibonacci study from which the 78.6% retracement helped to set the low after another brutal Sunday open this week. Chart prepared by James Stanley; Dow Jones on Tradingview It’s been a big week in the S&P 500 with prices up more than 18% from this week’s lows; which is, in and of itself, an astounding amount. But – this still isn’t even 38.2% of that prior sell-off, meaning there may be more room left to run, especially if the risk-on trade takes over again after the arsenal of stimulus that’s been launched. A similar bullish short-term structure has shown in the S&P 500, with a bit of governance produced by the same 2016-2020 major move. The 76.4% retracement helped to mark the low, the 61.8% retracement came in as support yesterday; and the 50% marker sits just ahead as the next potential spot of resistance, showing around the 2600 level. Chart prepared by James Stanley; SPX500 on Tradingview In a related move, the US Dollar has put in a large pullback, going along with the revivial of strength in US equities. In a move likely related to brute-force risk aversion in mid-March, the Greenback gained as much as 8.8%, non-levered, as investors rushed for the safety of the USD. As looked at yesterday, a mild pullback had shown in the early-portion of this week. That pullback turned deeper with aggression today as both Jerome Powell and Steven Mnuchin shared some supportive commentary earlier this morning. Powell said that the Fed’s funding is limited by what the Treasury would allow and, the Treasury, run by Steven Mnuchin, have shown no signs of yet letting up in the effort of stemming this sell-off head-on. This was ample motive for a deeper reversal and the US Dollar has been spiraling lower ever since. For the past four hours, as of this writing, the US Dollar has begun to dig-in at a key longer-term support level. The price of 99.34 is the 14.4% Fibonacci retracement of the 2011-2017 major move. Chart prepared by James Stanley; USD on Tradingview On a shorter-term basis, prices were catching support at the 23.6% retracement yesterday; but that has since been taken out and USD price action has even cut below the 38.2% marker of the recent bullish move. This leaves the 50% marker lurking underneath current price action as that next spot of potential support, plotted around the 98.86 level.

5e9516b370c1cb1006bc0e02	Dollar slips as risk appetite returns to market	"The dollar fell on Tuesday as risk sentiment returned to market following better-than-expected economic data from China which painted a less gloomy picture than feared following the coronavirus epidemic there. China's March exports fell 6.6% from a year earlier, compared with a forecast for a 14% drop, while imports fell by less than 1%, compared with a 9.5% drop predicted by economists. ""The dollar has retained a moderate softening bias amid a context of risk-on positioning and with global markets returning to full participation following the long weekends in many financial centres in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Chinese trade data for March provided bullish fodder for stock markets in Asia by showing an abatement in the rate of decline in imports and exports after the severe plunges in January and February,"" wrote analysts at Action Economics. Daily fatalities in the United States also fell sharply and states began making plans to reopen their economies, leaving traders to abandon the safety net of the highly liquid dollar and turn to riskier currencies. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six rivals, fell 0.4% in North American trade to 98.99. Against the euro, the dollar weakened by 0.5% to $1.097. The Australian dollar, which is sensitive to Chinese demand because of the country's dependence on raw materials exports, rose to a more than one-month high of 0.643 per U.S. dollar but had retraced some of those gains to last trade at 0.641. The Japanese yen rose versus the greenback to a two-week high of 107.20 yen. ""The ongoing improvement in global investor risk sentiment in the near-term combined with the Fed's aggressive policy response is beginning to weigh down more on the U.S. dollar,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG. The mood in the forex markets was pre-empted by leveraged funds, whose net short U.S. dollar positioning in the latest week touched its largest level since May 2018, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. The value of the net short dollar position was $10.5 billion in the week ended April 7, from net shorts of $9.9 billion the previous week. Speculators have been short on the U.S. dollar for four consecutive weeks. Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve rolled out a $2.3 trillion effort to bolster local governments and small and mid-sized businesses in its latest move to keep the U.S. economy intact as the country battles the coronavirus pandemic. The Fed's latest efforts have added to current dollar weakness, analysts say."	USD
5e8b9b69e4890d6f7679b662	Investors should prepare for a coronavirus-induced ‘vicious spiral’ more than twice as bad as the financial crisis, says J.P. Morgan	There is a widespread view on Wall Street that the stock market hit its lowest level of the bear market last month, and that a combination of an ebbing of the coronavirus in late spring and unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus will set the stage for a sharp rebound in corporate profits later this year. However, Mislav Matejka, head of global equity strategy at J.P. Morgan warned investors in a research note this week that there is a significant chance the global economy experiences “a vicious spiral, which is typical of recessions, between weak final demand, weaker labor markets, falling profits, weak credits markets and low oil prices.” What’s particularly troubling to Matejka is that the current recession has been triggered by a shock to the consumer — which makes up 70% of GDP in Western economies — as workers around the globe are prevented from earning a living by the closures of nonessential business. This dynamic has led J.P. Morgan economists to predict “only a gradual bottoming out in activity, such as seen after the Great Financial Crisis, and not a V-shaped one that we see, for example, after natural disasters.” A so-called V-shaped economic recession is typically defined as one characterized by a sharp, but brief, slowdown in business activity that is followed by a powerful rebound. The bank’s house view is that the unemployment rate will remain elevated at 8.5% during the second of the year, while the peak-to-trough decline in real U.S. GDP will be 10%, versus the 4% decline during the financial crisis. “And this is all assuming that the virus is history by June, which might prove significantly optimistic,” Matejka wrote. Therefore, he advised clients to ignore technical signals indicating stocks are oversold, or to be reassured by the massive fiscal and monetary support provided by global governments. To do so would be “missing the elephant in the room, that is the first consumer and labor market downcycle in 11 years.” “While consensus view still appears to be a quick recovery, recessions tend to linger,” Matejka added. “It took equities on average 18 months to record the final low in the past.” Economic data thus far show the beginnings of a negative feedback loop, he argued, where lower consumer spending leads to lower corporate profits, lower corporate investment, more job losses and further declines in consumer spending. This cycle can continue even when the reason for initial weakness has been removed, he said. “Here though, we worry about a Catch-22: the pace of consumer recovery in China is very slow, which could push economic forecasts of a recovery further out,” Matejka added. “On the other hand, the risk of a second wave of infections rises” if economic activity recovers too quickly. This is why J.P. Morgan strategists are closely watching the situation in China and South Korea. An absence of reaccleration of cases in those places is a necessary condition for a bottoming in stocks in the U.S. and Europe. In addition, Matejka advises clients to wait for the coming revision of earnings forecasts. So far S&P 500 earnings per share estimates have only come down 3%, versus the 20% to 40% typical of previous recessions. Once earnings estimates fall to necessary levels, it is possible that equity markets will finally begin to “over-discount” a recession. This would be indicated by the S&P 500 trading at 10 times forward earnings — a low seen in previous downturns—versus the roughly 14 times as of Friday’s close, creating an attractive entry point for investors, Matejka argued. U.S. stocks finished the holiday-shortened week sharply higher Thursday, with the main indexes recovering about half of their losses that were racked up in late March during the height of fears about the impact of COVID-19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.22% gained 285.80 points, or 1.2%, to close at 23,719.37, while the S&P 500 SPX, +1.44% jumped 39.84 points or 1.5% to end at 2,789.82. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.77% advanced 62.67 points to trade near 8,153.58, a 0.8% gain. For the week, the Dow rose 12.67%, the S&P 500 notched a 12.1% gain for the abbreviated week, marking its best weekly gain since 1974, and the Nasdaq rose 10.59%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. From its recent March 23 low, the Dow is up 25.01%, the S&P 500 is up 22.27% from that point and the Nasdaq is up 18.20%, according to FactSet data.

5e7400167615b415ee793b88	Dollar strengthens, boosted by worries over coronavirus impact	Just like consumers started a run on toilet paper, companies and institutions all over the world have created a shortage of dollars, as some players hoard more of the currency than they immediately need in response to fears about the coronavirus. In times of trouble, all sorts of companies, banks and investors want to hold dollars. It is the world’s reserve currency and considered the safest. So as financial markets careen, the demand for dollars is huge, and it’s exacerbating dislocations across financial markets. The demand is coming from all sorts of sources — banks, issuers of dollar-denominated debt; investors selling dollar-based assets; companies looking for cash for U.S. operations; and foreign banks looking to help customers. All of them are pressuring the currency. Investors have been selling financial assets around the world and that has been fueling even more demand for dollars and has been sending currencies lower. The selling has also snowballed, triggering even more asset sales, and more need for dollars. The Federal Reserve is expanding existing swap lines and adding lines to more central banks so that whatever institution needs dollar funding can have better access to it. Even with the Fed’s efforts, the U.S. dollar index continues to surge. The dollar index Thursday jumped 1.5% to 102.70, on top of a stunning rally since March 9, when it was only 95. “As soon as the Fed announced the swap line with Australia, the Australian dollar was one of the hardest hit, and it snapped back,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. The Australian dollar had fallen to an 18-year low of $0.55 per U.S. dollar, before rising to $0.577, roughly flat on the day. The Federal Reserve opened new swap lines Thursday with central banks in Australia, South Korea, Brazil and Mexico, among others, to help them deliver dollar funding to institutions in their regions. Chandler said the Bank for International Settlements estimates dollars are used to fund about $17 trillion in assets globally. But that did not solve the broader problem, with the dollar still rallying against other currencies globally. It was 2.2% higher Thursday against the euro and up 2.4% against the yen. The euro was at 1.06 to the dollar. “These are very sharp moves,” said Chandler. “What makes them sharp is partly that things were so calm before. These are also very elevated historically.” Chandler said for instance, three-month implied volatility for euro/dollar is at 14%, nearly three times above its 200-day moving average of 5.4%. The wild 8% move in the dollar in little over a week has also prompted market talk of a possible intervention by G-7 governments to bring down the dollar. “I think that it’s going to prove necessary.The big dollar rallies we’ve had ended with intervention. The first line of defense is to go to the swap line and let the swap lines work. I think we need another week to see if the increase in swap lines and the lower rates will ease the dislocation,” said Chandler. “I think the market is telling us they probably won’t.” Chandler said the last time there was a major intervention, it was to help Japan after the tsunami in 2011. The most famous intervention in recent history was the 1985 Plaza Accord to stop the dollar from surging and prevent inflation from building in other economies. “I don’t think the Europeans are worried about how weak the euro is,” said Chandler. “I think we have a little work to do to get to the conclusion that a high bar for intervention is necessary.” Bank of America strategists say the dollar may move just a few percent higher before the U.S. starts to seriously discuss an intervention to weaken the dollar. “Floating exchange rates are designed to address economic and terms-of-trade shocks such as this. A key tradeoff is shock absorption vs. market disorder and capital flight risk,” the BofA strategists wrote. “But because the virus is global, weak FX translates to tighter US financial conditions. Consequently, we suspect that the US could begin to push for a coordinated FX response with DXY above 104 and EUR/USD below 1.05 (highest and lowest levels since 2002).” Deutsche Bank FX strategist Alan Ruskin said there’s a clear mismatch in the market, driven by rapid market moves and the sudden rush by companies and institutions to move to cash. “I think it’s very hard to get dollars to the people who may need them most. There’s a variety of sources [seeking dollars]. Some of it is just bank related,” said Ruskin. “That’s a little like 2008. There’s a pretty obvious ingredient going on right now where some of the largest companies are drawing down their credit lines. That’s one of the more visible aspects of something that is more a plumbing type thing,” Ruskin said. There is also an element of investors favoring U.S. assets as a shelter, but this week’s selling in Treasurys, the ultimate safe haven, was in part due to investors selling bonds to raise dollars. Strategists said, like the households that grabbed all the toilet paper from store shelves, some institutions see the surge in demand as a reason to take more dollars than they now need. Companies drawing on credit lines threw another heavy drag onto the system. “Everyone draws down their credit lines because they think ‘I better get that liquidity when it’s still good,’” said Ruskin. Ruskin said all sorts of institutions and companies appear to be hoarding dollars. “They normally were getting that money through swap lines, and they find that source was drying up, and they might hold on to that liquidity as well, knowing there’s considerable demand,” he said. “If you can get credit, you’ll take it basically. It’s not costing you very much … I think the financial institutions have had experience in the past, and they want to hold onto liquidity as well. It’s not as easy to get to non-U.S. banks. That’s where you’re seeing the stress in the currency market,” said Ruskin. Strategists say the situation is also very different than 2008, when institutions feared counter-party risk and banks were afraid of dealing with each other. This time, the pandemic coronavirus has created an unknown hit to the economy as cases begin to rise globally, including to 10,000 in the U.S. That makes all sorts of institutions and companies want to hang on to as much cash as possible, and they want it in dollars. “There’s almost a sharper edge in a way, in so much as there’s some sense of totality,” Ruskin said. “It’s hitting such a substantial part of the economy in a complete way - literally visible shut down.” When Lehman Brothers closed in 2008, there was a concentrated impact on the financial sector and housing. “This has a different feel to it. It’s clearly global and in certain sectors there’s a complete shutdown and then there’s the financial angle … which is only now kicking in,” Ruskin said.	USD
5e68f9e2b7ebbe364ceb759f	Dollar falls vs yen, Swiss franc; sterling up after BoE rate cut	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar resumed its decline against the Japanese yen and Swiss franc on Wednesday, as fears over the spreading coronavirus pushed investors into safe havens, even as sterling recovered after the Bank of England unexpectedly cut interest rates. Central banks and governments around the world are scrambling to limit the economic damage of the coronavirus outbreak, which has sent stock markets into a tailspin as investors head for the safety of government bonds. Investors were also disappointed after President Donald Trump made no major announcements on stimulus measures. Expectations that Trump will unveil a significant stimulus plan had bolstered risk appetite on Tuesday and prompted investors to temporarily move away from safer assets. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would ask Congress for a payroll tax cut and other “very major” stimulus moves, but the details remain unclear. Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York, said U.S. leadership on the coronavirus issue seems lacking. He added that this has created a “clear vacuum in the markets and other authorities are trying to step into the void to calm financial markets and restore a semblance of trust and confidence in a system that is quickly spinning out of control.” Sterling initially fell as much as 0.4% against the dollar and 1.2% against the euro after the BoE cut its benchmark rate by 50 basis points, to 0.25%. But the pound rebounded as the move - including actions to support bank borrowing - reassured some investors. The pound was last up 0.3% at $1.2954 GBP=D3. Against the euro, the pound slipped 0.1% to 87.65 pence per euro . The dollar was down sharply against the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc. It lost nearly 1% to 104.62 yen, falling more than a full yen from Tuesday’s high of 105.915. The dollar also fell 0.7% against the Swiss franc to 0.9336 franc CHF=, while the euro rose 0.6% to $1.1340. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar fell 0.3% to 96.061. Money markets are fully pricing in a further 10 basis-point cut by the European Central Bank when it meets on Thursday. The BoE rate cut follows similar moves by U.S. and Canadian central banks and puts more pressure on the ECB to act, although it has limited room with rates already negative. “The pound sold off initially on the aggressive move but the statement shows that their (BoE) action is coordinated with the Treasury and the measures include a package for lending,” said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank. “Altogether the statement suggests lots of co-ordination. This is reassuring and should help limit the impact on the economy and that could also help support the pound.” Graphic: World FX rates in 2020 here Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Additional reporting by Iain Withers in London; Editing by Nick Zieminski	USD
5e5d07555040145532db6427	GBP/USD still has some upside after the reshuffle rally	Bulldozing Boris – Prime Minister Boris Johnson ran down the now former Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid, making way for Rishi Sunak. More importantly for sterling traders – the change paves the way for infrastructure spending, relieving the Bank of England of the need to provide monetary stimulus. The new pair on Downing Street – Johnson at No. 10 and Sunak at 11 – will likely scrap deficit obligations set by Javid and increase the debt. British bond yields rose in response, but they remain low and allow London cheap funding for big projects such as the controversial HS2 rail. Javid tendered his resignation after Johnson demanded that he fire all his advisers, allowing Dominic Cummings – the PM’s powerful aide – to fill in the posts. Some see Sunak as a yes-man and Johnson’s move as a power grab. However, in a world where debt does not matter – as seen in ballooning US obligations – markets are cheering. The reshuffle also provides a united front ahead of post-Brexit talks with the EU. Both sides have been posturing of late, with traders learning to ignore it. Official negotiations kick off in March and further rhetoric – reflecting the divide on regulatory alignment and other topics – may move the pound. Will this uptrend continue? Apart from reactions to Thursday’s reshuffle, pound/dollar is facing other significant developments. The coronavirus outbreak remains high in the headlines, with a fresh deceleration in the number of cases, following Thursday’s leap. Nevertheless, there is significant uncertainty about the economic impact for China – the world’s second-largest economy – and for the rest of the world. Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, said that it may take one or two quarters to assess the economic impact of the respiratory disease. Stock markets have remained calm but investors may opt to take profits ahead of the weekend. US shares slid in five of six Fridays so far in 2020. A risk-averse market mood may push the safe-haven dollar higher. The US consumer may also lend its support to the greenback. Economists expect retail sales figures for January to continue rising. America’s shopping spree has driven the economy forward. Later, the first read of the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index is set to remain at high levels near 100 – reflecting optimism. See: Overall, echoes from the reshuffling, Brexit, coronavirus, and US data are all in the mix. The four-hour chart provides a favorable outlook for cable bulls. GBP/USD has surpassed the 200 Simple Moving Average, after topping the 50 and 100 SMAs. Momentum is to the upside while the Relative Strength Index is still below 70 – outside overbought conditions. Resistance awaits at Thursday’s high of 1.3070, which was also a swing high last week. It is followed by 1.3110, a stepping stone on the way up in late January. Further above, 1.3175 and 1.3220 await the currency pair. Support awaits at 1.2990, which capped sterling on its way up earlier this week. Next, 1.2940 provided support twice in February. 1.2900 and the 2020 low of 1.2875 are next.	GBP
5e6231085c8ee0051bd4caaf	EUR/USD Price Soars as US Bond Yields Crumble to Record Lows	The US dollar continues its recent freefall against a range of G7 currencies with EUR/USD now looking to break above 1.1300 and beyond. This week’s emergency 50 basis point Fed interest rate cut pulled the rug from under the greenback as markets decided that the move was not enough. Markets have now fully priced in a 25bp rate cut at the March 17-18 FOMC meeting and a 50bp cut is nearly fully priced in. US Treasury yields continue to slump with the 10-year now offering just 73 basis points - a record low - while the 30-year UST offers a miserly 1.32%. Bond yields fall as prices rise. We looked at EUR/USD on Thursday and suggested that a move to the December 31 high around 1.1239 looked imminent and this level has now been breached and convincingly. Euro Price Outlook: EUR/USD ‘V-shaped’ Recovery Nears Completion The recent CoT report showed that EUR short positions had grown over the week, and it is likely the recent spike higher in Euro against the US dollar are these shorts now rushing to cover their positions. EUR/USD is now looking for its next upside target with little in the way of resistance ahead of 1.1412. The latest move has also negated the run of lower highs on the chart, another positive for EUR/USD bulls. There is a potential roadblock for higher prices later today with the February US Jobs Report scheduled for release at 13:30 GMT, an event that normally sparks US dollar volatility and movement. Market expectations are for 175k new jobs to have been created in the month, compared to 225k in January, and a number today nearer 200k may stem the US dollar sell-off in the short-term. A miss to the downside may well extend US dollar losses going into the weekend.

5e81b594c496d2354de72fd1	Safe-havens rally as investors go holiday-mode until NFP	It seems markets will either need to see substantial progress on trade or stronger easing signals to yield any major moves. Light volumes are expected until we get to Friday’s employment report, which economists see rebounding to 164,000 jobs. Fed funds futures contract are fully pricing in a rate cut at the July 31st meeting, with markets split whether we see an additional one or two cuts by the end of the year. Regarding trade both the US and China continue to highlight positive steps and that talks are ongoing. Markets will become more optimistic if we see both sides agree to schedule another meeting to iron out details on enforcement and structural reform. If the Xi and Trump want a deal to finalize before October, the Chinese need to take back some of the red ink they put in place in May when talks blew up. Stocks For US stocks to continue the march further into uncharted territory, the world’s largest two economies need to show some trade war concessions on both sides and for the Fed to signal they will not signal they will stand pat after delivering a 25 basis-point cut. Markets need a punch bowl and not just a drink to continue drive stocks higher. Oil Oil producing countries signaled production cuts will be extended another nine months, taking the effort to balance the oil market to beyond three years. Oil prices are trading sharply lower after a wrath of softer global manufacturing data hinted that central banks are behind the curve in delivery fresh stimulus. If we are in the beginning of global slowdown, the effects of fresh stimulus will take months before filtering into the economy. Crude prices appear vulnerable markets are beginning to price in this will be the last production cuts we see from OPEC +. It is hard to imagine a scenario that would see all countries remain supportive for cuts at the next meeting which will be closer to the end of the year. Gold Safe-havens are shining bright today as global slowdown worries are growing. The initial trade truce risk-on rally is over, and markets have little to show in hopes of a trade deal getting finalized anytime soon. The de-escalation in fresh tariff threats might not be enough to ease falling sentiment concerns. The other key catalyst for safe-haven demand is the expectations on how accommodative the Fed will be in the coming months. If we continue to see the US data points deteriorate, we could see safety trades reign supreme this summer. The Japanese yen is also benefiting with the flight to safety and is the best performing currency on the day. This article is for general information purposes only.

5e73d67f621fea4adc618ea4	Norway may Intervene and Buy Krone	Two of the largest moves we have seen over the past 2 weeks have been the strong bid in the US Dollar and the dramatic fall in the price of crude oil. So, what happens to a country ‘s currency (vs the USD) that relies on oil and gas for 40% of its export revenue and 20% of its GDP? It falls 30% in less than 2 weeks! On March 9th, the day after Saudi Arabia said it would counter Russia’s refusal to cut supply by pumping its own oil as much as possible, the Norwegian Krone stood near 9.2500. Today, less than 2 weeks later, the pair reached a high of 12.1224. Nearly halfway through the move, the Norges Bank held an emergency meeting and cut interest rates from 1.5% to 1.0%. However, this action failed to halt the move higher and it continued this week. Today, the Norges Bank said it would consider intervening in the market and buying the Krone to slow the devaluation. The Norges Bank has not intervened in the market since 1999. The Central Bank also said they would offer loans for up to 12 months to help those affected by the coronavirus. As a result, after putting in today’s highs, USD/NOK retraced on the day and ended up putting in a LARGE shooting star candlestick formation. A shooting star is a one candle formation indicating a possible reversal. Resistance isn’t until today’s highs near 12.1225 and first support isn’t until yesterday’s lows near 10.5000. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com USD/NOK isn’t the only Norwegian Krone pair to reverse today. The result of the Norges Bank comments also had a reversal effect on the EUR/NOK after a 20% run up during the same timeframe. Resistance again is at today’s highs near 13.1492. Horizontal support is near 11.5980, then yesterday’s lows at 11.5072. The pair also put in a huge shooting star formation. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Note that towards the end of the Crude Oil Futures trading session, US President Trump hinted that the US may intervene and buy oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). This helped Crude Oil’s rally of 25% today, however most of the move was during the US session, and well after the Norges Bank comments. But this did help reinforce a lower USD/NOK. Source: Tradingview, NYMEX, FOREX.com When it comes to trading the Norwegian Krone, there are at least 3 factors we need to pay close attention to: The direction and the magnitude of the price of the US Dollar The direction and the magnitude of the price of Crude Oil Comments from Norges Bank officials These are all currently driving the price of USD/NOK and EUR/NOK. A change in any one of them could result in a change in direction of the Norwegian Krone.	NOK
5e81b5e9c496d2354de73022	Fed to set the tone for the U.S dollar	Wednesday March 20: Five things the markets are talking about All eyes are on today’s FOMC meeting where the Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady, announce plans for the end of asset roll-off from its balance sheet, and lower its “dot-plot” projections for the number of interest-rate hikes this year. Market participants will also be scrutinizing whether dealer expectations of a rate cut in 2020 has any substance. Nevertheless, global equities are either trading mixed or are lower as investors adopt a cautious approach ahead of the Fed’s decision (2 pm EDT) and further news on Sino-U.S trade talks, where negotiators are said to remain at “odds.” U.S Treasury yields are trading atop of the recent low yields, while the ‘big’ dollar has found some traction after a few sessions of underperforming. Elsewhere, the pound is drifting as the market eyes PM Theresa May’s efforts to draft a request for an extension to conclude a Brexit deal that could pass Parliament in another meaningful vote. On tap: The Bank of England (BoE) and Swiss National Bank (SNB) deliver their interest rate decisions tomorrow, while on Friday, Euro-zone purchasing manager survey numbers will give an indication of the health of the region’s industrial and service sectors. 1. Stocks mixed results In Japan, the Nikkei saw a small gain overnight as the market awaits the Fed’s decision. The index share average ended +0.2% higher after trading in negative territory in early trade. The broader Topix added +0.3%. Note: Japanese markets are closed on Thursday for a bank holiday. Down-under, Aussie stocks ended lower overnight after reports of tension in Sino-U.S trade talks soured sentiment. The S&P/ASX 200 index declined -0.32% at the close of trade. The benchmark was little changed on Tuesday. In S. Korea, the Kospi stock index ended steady earlier this morning, recouping much of its losses, as tech shares lifted the market in the late trading. The index closed little changed, down -0.02%. In China, equities were little changed overnight ahead of the Fed decision and on uncertainty surrounding Sino-U.S trade negotiations. Both the Shanghai Composite index and the blue-chip CSI300 index settled unchanged. In Hong Kong, it was a different scenario, both the Hang Seng index and the Hang Seng China Enterprises index ended down -0.5%. In Europe, regional bourses trade lower across the board following on from a mixed session in Asia and slightly higher U.S futures this morning. U.S stocks are set to open in the ‘black’ (+0.7%). Indices: Stoxx600 -0.34% at 382.98, FTSE -0.01% at 7,322.97, DAX -1.02% at 11,669.32, CAC-40 -0.13% at 5,418.75, IBEX-35 -0.17% at 9,476.05, FTSE MIB -0.02% at 21,425.50, SMI -0.40% at 9,487.50, S&P 500 Futures +0.07% 2. Oil prices firm on supply cuts, but slowing economy drags Oil prices have edged a tad higher, supported by ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC+ and U.S sanctions against Iran and Venezuela, although gains remain capped by market concerns over economic growth. Brent crude futures are at +$67.79 a barrel, up +18c, or +0.3% from Tuesday’s close. U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures are at +$59.09 per barrel, up +6c, or +0.1% from their previous close. Note: WTI on Tuesday reached its highest level since Nov. 12 at +$59.57 a barrel, while Brent touched its highest since Nov. 16 at +$68.20 a barrel. Both global growth concerns and ongoing oversupply fears are creating headwinds for the commodity. OPEC and a group of 10 oil-producing nations led by Russia are deepening their crude production cuts but remain split on whether the curbs should remain in place through the end of the year. Data from the API yesterday showed that U.S crude, gasoline and distillate inventories unexpectedly fell in the week to March 15. Expect dealers to take their cues from today’s U.S EIA report, which is due to publish its weekly crude production and storage level report around 10:30 am EDT. Ahead of the U.S open, gold has slipped as the dollar gains ground ahead of the Fed’s policy decision. Spot gold is down about -0.4% at -$1,301.38 per ounce, while U.S gold futures have also slipped -0.4% to +$1,301.7. 3. Sovereign yields wait for Fed’s Powell U.S Treasury’s and core eurozone bond yields have eased away from their two-week highs print of yesterday, as dealers wait for further clarity on the direction of U.S rates and the market struggles to make sense of the UK’s Brexit negotiations. Currently, futures pricing suggests the next move by the Fed will be a rate cut, likely in 2020, though most expect one more hike this year, likely in June. Also, U.S policy makers are expected to release details of their plan to end the monthly reduction of its massive balance sheet. The yield on 10-year Treasuries remained at +2.61%, while the yield on Germany’s 10-year Bund currently trades at +0.10%. Down-under, Australia’s 10-year bond yield is steady at +1.94%. Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) minutes last night indicated that Governor Kuroda and the central bank remain on the “dovish” side and will continue its persistent large-scale easing. Japan Finance Minister Aso stated that he had no difference with PM Abe on BoJ’s +2% price target. He indicated that he had discussed numerous times with BoJ’s Kuroda that it was becoming “very difficult to achieve price goal when plunging oil prices weighed on inflation.” 4. Dollar in small demand The USD is little changed against G10 currency pairs as the markets focus remains on the upcoming Fed policy decision later today. Expectations are for accommodative Fed rhetoric given the recent soft U.S data. Sterling (£1.3231) is little affected by the modest increase in U.K inflation headline print this morning (see below). The markets focus remains on Brexit and the EU Council meeting on Thursday and Friday. PM Theresa May is supposedly asking for a three-month Article 50 extension. A longer delay would provide a bid for the pound. However, dealers have noted that the current environment suggested that “no-deal” risk could be back around the end of June. The pound is last down -0.3% at $1.3227. EUR/GBP rises +0.2% to €0.8577. Elsewhere, EUR/USD is little changed at €1.1345 area, while USD/JPY is at ¥111.55 just ahead of the U.S morning. 5. U.K inflation inches higher last month Data this morning shows that inflation in the U.K. ticked up in February, fed by higher prices for food, alcohol and video games. According to the ONS, consumer prices rose +1.9% in the year through February, compared with an annual gain of +1.8% the previous 12 months. Note: The BoE has signaled to hike up interest rates slowly three or more times in the next couple of years to keep inflation at its +2% annual target, provided that the U.K’s exit from the EU goes smoothly. Also, the ONS said house prices in London fell -1.6% on year in January, the seventh consecutive month of declines. Note: Prices in London are now -3.3% below their July 2017 peak.

5e5df2982fb2162b6fe42192	US Dollar, USD/MYR May Rise After Bank of Malaysia on Epidemic Woes	The US Dollar could see strength against the Malaysian Ringgit in the near-term. USD/MYR is eyeing the upcoming Bank of Malaysia interest rate announcement due at 7:00 GMT. A 25-basis point reduction in the overnight policy rate is expected from 2.75% to 2.50%. That would mark back-to-back easing efforts so far this year. Since 2020 began, USD/MYR has thus climbed an impressive 3.81%. The timing of monetary easing is of utmost importance with the ongoing coronavirus outbreak threatening to hurt global growth prospects. Over the weekend, China saw gauges of manufacturing activity shrink by the most on record and surpassing lows after the 2008 financial crisis. Malaysia has an important trading relationship with the world’s second-largest economy, implying downside knock-on effects. At the same time, the nation is experiencing some political uncertainty after Mahathir Mohamad’s sudden resignation. That temporarily threw fiscal stimulus bets into doubt, though the former Prime Minister still delivered his fiscal stimulus plan. This amounts to about MYR20b to boost economic growth after Muhyiddin Yassin was sworn in as the new prime minister over the weekend. He comes into power amid deteriorating local economic conditions. The latest figures saw GDP rise by the weakest since 2009. On the chart below, the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index is down over 22% since April 2018. This means it has effectively surpassed bear-market territory. Though at this point, key rising support from the 1997 Asia Financial Crisis is maintaining the long-term upward bias. Chart Created in TradingView With that in mind, the near-term upside risk from a sentiment standpoint for USD/MYR is a resumption of the selloff in global equities. This follows the worst week on Wall Street since 2008. The markets are increasingly pricing in prospects of a global coordinated move in monetary easing with fiscal stimulus. Yet, a draft of Tuesday’s G-7 summit somewhat downplays these hopes. Keep a close eye on the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (EEM), which tends to inversely follow USD/MYR. If the markets are too exuberantly pricing in global stimulus prospects, that may plunge the EEM, perhaps boosting USD/MYR. The medium-term risk from the market mood point is the limits of monetary policy given that most major central banks were unable to successfully unwind easing efforts over the past decade. The USD/MYR dominant uptrend is being maintained by rising support from January. In February, prices closed above falling resistance from August, shifting the medium-term outlook bullish. Since then, prices struggled to confirm a break above highs from 2019 which if taken out, may prolong the USD/MYR uptrend. Otherwise, a turn lower places the focus on 4.1850 followed by 4.1630 on the daily chart below.

5e8df09be762a7366e25103a	Silver and Gold -Which is Better to Own Right Now?	It’s been quite a ride for the two precious metals since the coronavirus outbreak began in late February. Gold (XAUUSD) up in a new recent high on March 9th and for 8 of the next 9 trading days, traded lower, down almost 15% as gold was sold to raise cash for margin in stocks as equity markets continued to sell off. However, as buying pressure came back on March 23rd and 24th, it was discovered that there was a problem in the EFP market and banks could not meet the demand for physical gold. This sent prices higher. Yesterday, price traded within 24 dollars from the March 9th highs. Also, Gold put in a bearish candle (slightly missing the true definition of a dark cloud cover, in which price would have had to have closed 50% below the prior day’s highs), however it is still within 50 dollars from the recent highs. If there is a risk off move in the markets, this may catapult Gold to new highs. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Silver (XAGUSD) has had a similar experience as Gold over the last month. Silver put in a recent high on February 24th at 18.929, however as Gold was putting in a new high on March 9th, Silver could only trade back up to 50% of its February 24th high to March 2nd low at 17.587. The metal then proceeded to sell of 40% from its February 24th highs, whereas gold only sold of 15%! Silver then bounced along with Gold over the course of the new 2 weeks. However, as Gold traded back to within spitting distance of its prior highs, Silver could only retrace 50% of its high to low move, back to 15.09. Silver put in a gravestone doji on yesterday’s daily candlestick chart. This is considered a reversal candle. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Now, let’s look at the Gold/Silver ratio (XAUXAG) and see which is performing better on a relative basis. From February 19th to March 18th, the ratio skyrocketed from 87.331 to 128.692. This is the period that silver sold off 40% while gold only sold off 15%. However, since then, the ratio has been pulling back. This is because Silver has been outperforming Gold on a relative basis. The ratio is currently at an inflection point, the 50% retracement level from the February 19th lows to the March 18th highs at 107.72. Yesterday, although the ratio broke support, the candle was a hammer, indicating a possible reversal. If the ratio breaks lower, next support is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the same time period at 102.78. However, if the ratio can close above resistance at yesterday’s highs or 111.108, Gold could outperform silver and the ratio could move to next resistance at 116, then previous highs at 128.651. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com So, which is better to own right now, Gold or Silver? The Gold/Silver ratio (XAUXAG) has recently pulled back 50%, therefore it may be due for a rebound. If that is the case, Gold would be the better buy. However, it the ratio breaks below the 50% level, further downside may be in order, which would mean Silver is the better metal to own. More evidence is probably necessary to make that decision. However regardless of which you want to own, if see we a risk off move, both should move higher!	USD
5e5d0920bd5d9d5ac072764c	Impact of Virus Outbreaks: S&P 500, Gold, Oil and Currency Analysis	S&P 500, Gold, Crude Oil & Forex Analysis *** Article Originally Published on January 31, 2020 *** The outbreak of the Wuhan Coronavirus has rattled financial markets across the globe, although much is unknown as to whether the outbreak will expand to a pandemic and what the size of the impact will be. In order to gauge the potential impact of coronavirus, this article will compare previous virus outbreaks and trends across the S&P 500, major commodities and currencies. With that said, we are cognizant to the fact that China is more connected to the global economy, contributing a growing proportion to world GDP (~20%) compared to 2002-03 (~5%) when SARS broke out. Furthermore, the mortality rate of the Coronavirus is materially lower than SARS at 2-3% vs 9.6%, which has eased concerns. However, it is quite clear that there are increasing concerns about Coronavirus as it continues to spread, and this is reflected in the chart below. The data shows that the rising number of searches in Google is at its highest on record, surpassing the peak in 2009. Across equity markets, S&P 500 generally performed better against its counterparts during virus outbreaks, while the DAX 30 had been the most negatively impacted during the SARS outbreak. However, despite equity markets initially coming under pressure, weakness was typically temporary with global equity markets showing a sharp recovery. Alongside this, the most adversely effected stock markets tended to show the strongest rebound. *0=First outbreak of virus During the SARS outbreak, the spillover onto G10 currencies had been limited at best as the larger focus for investors had been on the global macro backdrop. This had been the global reflationary story as economies came out of the recession that took place in the early 2000s. As such, given that the global economy had been early in the economic cycle, notable outperformance had been observed in the AUD, CAD and NZD during the SARS episode (macro backdrop matters). Subsequently, this also helps explain the modest gains in the Euro and Pound, while the US Dollar had been under pressure. Similarly, safe-haven currencies (JPY, CHF) saw little in the way of notable movement during the outbreak. A better assessment of the SARS impact would be to look at local currencies. Asian FX pairs had notably weakened against the greenback with the Philippine Peso and South Korean Won the most negatively impacted. With that said, with previous virus outbreaks (SARS) suggesting that the macro backdrop matters, then the fact that uncertainty remains over potential economic vulnerabilities, commodity linked currencies that have previously outperformed its counterparts could instead be among the underperformers. *Charts are rebased from September 1st, 2002 = 100 Gold prices typically rise during virus outbreaks with SARS having had the largest impact on the precious metal, which rose as much as 18% in the first three months following the outbreak. Elsewhere, oil prices have seen a larger drop in response to the Coronavirus than has previously been the case. --- Written by Justin McQueen, Market Analyst Follow Justin on Twitter @JMcQueenFX	USD
5e7aad3df9505f2f4e6a5d20	AUD/USD Rate Rebound in Focus as RSI Displays Buy Signal	AUD/USD extends the rebound from earlier this week amid the wave of new measures announced by the Federal Reserve, and the exchange rate looks poised for a larger recovery as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) displays a textbook buy signal. AUD/USD extends the rebound from the yearly low (0.5506) as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) launches three new credit facilities along with plans to purchase commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), and the extraordinary efforts may generate a near-term correction in the exchange rate as Chairman Jerome Powell and Co. plan toestablish“a Main Street Business Lending Program to support lending to eligible small-and-medium sized businesses.” The unprecedented response by the FOMC appears to be shoring up investor confidence as the S&P 500 notched its largest single day gain on a percentage basis since October 2008, and the wave of monetary/fiscal stimulus may continue to curb the flight to safety as major central banks keep the door open to deploy more unconventional tools to combat the weakening outlook for growth. In turn, it remains to be seen if the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will continue to push monetary policy into uncharted territory amid the growing number of COVID-19 cases, and a further depreciation in the Australian Dollar may force Governor Philip Lowe and Co. to intervene in the currency market as the central bank stands ready to “to support smooth market functioning when liquidity conditions are highly stressed.” Nevertheless, the recent rebound in AUD/USD may encourage the RBA to retain the current policy at the next meeting on May 5, and the exchange rate may stage a larger rebound over the remainder of the month as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) displays a textbook buy signal.

5e83466c0a93c67d669fb501	I’m retired and claim Social Security — do I still get the $1,200 stimulus check?	Many Americans are expecting a check from the federal government within the next month, as part of a stimulus package intended to provide the country financial relief as COVID-19 stresses physical and financial health around the world. Retirees and those who claim Social Security are a part of that group, though they may face some complications, experts said. Overall, the package is pretty straightforward surrounding the rebate checks: Americans who make no more than $75,000 will receive $1,200, and double that if they are married and making $150,000 or less. Payments start to decrease thereafter, and those who earn $99,000 as a single individual or $198,000 as a married couple will not receive any money. Heads of households have a limit of $146,500. Individuals with children will receive $500 for every child. See: What the $2 trillion stimulus means for you — and how the ‘recovery rebates’ to households will be calculated To be eligible, recipients cannot be nonresident alien individuals or dependents for someone else. Income is determined by a person’s adjusted gross income, or AGI. The extra income is part of a $2 trillion stimulus package focused on combating the consequences of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 551,000 people around the world and killed nearly 25,000. Part of the package includes relief to small businesses, which have been hit hard from state and city lockdowns, as well as more robust unemployment benefits. The Senate passed the bill overnight on Thursday, and the House is expected to vote on it Friday afternoon. The U.S. is now ranked with the highest number of confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering. Government and health care officials across the country expect to see countless more cases before the situation gets better. Also see: Schumer says coronavirus stimulus package won’t provide aid to Trump family’s businesses The checks, which are nontaxable, will be based on 2019 tax returns if they’ve already been filed (though the deadline has been delayed to July 15), and for those who have yet to send in their returns, 2018 figures. The checks are based on all income, which means retirees, Social Security and those who claim other benefits, such as Supplemental Security Income, are eligible. The IRS said on Monday senior citizens, those who claim Social Security benefits and some veterans will need to file a simple tax return to receive the payment, though they will not owe tax for doing so. . Certain cases may make it tricky for retirees to get the proper amount though, experts said. There are circumstances where retirees may have been working in 2018, or even 2019, and earning more than the income limits, but now are below those thresholds, said Jamie Hopkins, director of retirement research at Carson Group. There are also instances where people may get more in their checks than they should have, such as for those who earned less in the previous year but more now. They will get to keep the full amount of the check, said Jeffrey Levine, director of advanced planning at Buckingham Wealth Partners. Congress has not yet shared how exactly the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service will handle special cases, nor have they said what the cutoff is for receiving 2019 tax returns to base their check calculations. The bill is was delayed in the House. More from MarketWatch Alessandra Malito is a retirement reporter based in New York. You can follow her on Twitter @malito_ali. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc.

5e5d08dc73d82f5acc8afc9d	Nice Double Bottom on AUD/NZD!	As we have been discussing for months, both the Australian economy and the New Zealand economy are heavily dependent on the Chinese economy. Not to sound like a broken record, but China is a large importer of goods and services from both Australia and New Zealand. So, if China’s economy slows, demand for goods and services will slow as well. We first began discussing this issue in the Fall of 2019, as the US-China Phase One negotiation was in full force. Once Phase One was agreed, and finally signed on January 15th, news began to spread of the Coronavirus. Just as traders thought these two economies were out of the woods, these new fears developed for both Aussie and Kiwi traders. On November 7th, 2019, AUD/NZD put in a high at 1.0865 and traded down to a low of 1.0361 on January 7th. Price bounced, then tested that low once again on January 24th. Again, price bounced. After putting in indecision candles on Thursday and Friday, price gapped open lower today and began traded higher, forming a large bullish candle. In doing so, price broke through the most recent highs at 1.0459, therefore forming the neckline of a double bottom price formation. The target for a Double Bottom is the distance from the bottom to the top of the formation, added to the breakout point. This would put the target just about 1.0600. To get there though, price would have to break through immediate horizontal resistance at 1.0472 and the 200 Day Moving Average at 1.0553. In addition, price would need to break both the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement and the 50% retracement levels from the highs on November 7th to the lows on January 7th at 1.0521 and 1.0587, respectively. Don’t be surprised if price doesn’t move in a straight line to target! Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com On a 240-minute timeframe, price and RSI are diverging on a rising wedge pattern. When price puts in 3 new highs in a row and the RSI puts 3 lower highs in a row, this is often referred to as a 3-drive pattern (taught to me by Dale Pinkert). This is a high probability pattern which indicates that price may turn lower soon. (This is another reason price may not run to the target of the double bottom pattern in a straight line). If price does pullback, support is at the bottom trendline of the rising wedge near 1.0400, horizontal support near 1.0365 and the target for the rising wedge pattern near 1.0325. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com The RBA held interest rates steady at 0.75% at their meeting last week, citing strong employment and housing. They bought themselves time to see how the coronavirus plays out. However, they did say that they may cut rates some time in Q2. The RBNZ meets Wednesday. Although expectations were for a cut to 0.75% from 1% at their last meeting on November 13th, they left rates unchanged. Expectations for this meeting are for the RBNZ to leave rates unchanged at 1%. It will be interesting to see how the board members choose to deal with a possible China slowdown due to the coronavirus. Can they buy time, as the RBA did? Their next Interest rate decision meeting is March 25th.	NZD
5e9579e6cd4eb414d8f405c6	Dollar slips as Chinese data improves	LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell Tuesday, much to the enjoyment of sterling and Australian dollar holders, after better-than-expected economic data from China which painted a less gloomy picture of the new coronavirus’ economic fallout than markets had feared. China’s March exports fell 6.6% from a year earlier, compared with a forecast for a 14% drop and imports fell by less than 1%, compared with a 9.5% drop anticipated by economists. Daily fatalities in the United States also fell sharply and states began plans to re-open their economies, leaving traders to abandon the safety net of the most liquid currency - the dollar - and turn to more risky currencies. The Australian dollar rose to a more than one-month high of 0.6432 per U.S. dollar AUD=D3 and was last up 0.5%. Sterling went up by the same magnitute, touching $1.2575, its highest since March 13, up 0.5% on the day GBP=D3. The pound had been closely linked to the performance of the equity market for the past weeks. The euro inched higher by 0.2% to $1.0932 EUR=EBS. The only currency the dollar was down against in the major economies was the Japanese yen, which rose 0.1% versus the greenback to 107.69 yen JPY=EBS. “The ongoing improvement in global investor risk sentiment in the near-term combined with the Fed’s aggressive policy response is beginning to weigh down more on the U.S. dollar,” said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG. The mood in the forex markets was preempted by leveraged funds last week, whose net short U.S. dollar positioning in the latest week touched their largest level since May 2018, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. The value of the net short dollar position was $10.5 billion in the week ended on April 7, from net shorts of $9.9 billion the previous week. Speculators have been short on the U.S. dollar for four consecutive weeks. (GRAPHIC: Speculators go even shorter on U.S. dollar - here) Reporting by Olga Cotaga; Editing by Angus MacSwan	USD
5e5d07b4203be655205b7ab4	Dollar index at near 3-year high as yen sinks on stronger risk appetite	The U.S. dollar climbed on Wednesday to near a three-year high against a basket of other currencies and the safe-haven yen sank to a nine-month low as a decline in the number of new coronavirus cases in China and expectations for more policy stimulus boosted investors’ appetite for risk. Strong U.S. data that could support the Federal Reserve’s desire to keep interest rates unchanged after lowering borrowing costs three times in 2019, supported the greenback. China posted the lowest daily rise in new coronavirus cases since Jan. 29. Many view Chinese data on the virus with skepticism, but sentiment was lifted by a Bloomberg report that Beijing was considering cash injections or mergers to bail out airlines hit by the virus. Those steps would come after this week’s cut in the medium-term lending rate, which has fed expectations for a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate. “China is trying to rev up some stimulus to offset some of the negative economic impacts from the issues going on with the coronavirus,” said Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California. Against the Japanese yen, which tends to benefit during geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the worlds biggest creditor nation, the dollar rose 0.96% to 110.91, its highest since May. Worries about Japan’s economy, which shrank at the fastest pace in almost six years in the December quarter, were also weighing on the yen, Trang said. Investors are awaiting the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s January meeting, due at 1900 GMT. “The focus will be on the balance sheet management by the Fed,” Trang said. On Wednesday, the dollar was supported by data that showed U.S. homebuilding fell less than expected in January while permits surged to a near 13-year high, pointing to sustained housing market strength. Other data showed producer prices increasing by the most in more than one year last month. The U.S. Dollar Currency Index, which measures the greenback’s strength against six other major currencies, rose 0.24% at 99.688, its highest since May 12, 2017. The euro bounced briefly above $1.08 but sank below the mark to trade down slightly against the greenback. The single currency had earlier fallen to a three-year low after a survey showed weakening confidence in Germany. Sterling slipped back under $1.30, shrugging off data showing an unexpected surge in UK inflation to a six-month high in January as focus returned to Britain’s trade talks with the European Union and government plans to boost spending.

5e96d3a067590f0eebb77a37	Sterling slips from one-month highs on broadly resurgent dollar	LONDON (Reuters) - The pound slipped on Wednesday, falling back from its monthly highs against the dollar and euro, after a dire global economic forecast from the International Monetary Fund diminished risk appetite broadly, boosting the dollar. The global economy is expected to shrink by 3.0% during 2020 in a coronavirus-driven collapse of activity that will mark the steepest downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the IMF said. “It is not (yet) clear whether economies will recover quickly or whether it might take longer than assumed so that we are more likely to see an L-shaped recovery as standard,” said Antje Praefcke, an analyst at Commerzbank. A weakening global economy enhances the safe-haven appeal of the U.S. dollar as it is the major currency in global trade and the predominant medium of exchange in world markets. Versus a broadly firmer dollar, the pound was down as much as 0.9%, at $1.2514, erasing Tuesday’s gains. Against the euro, it fell to 87.38 pence per euro. The pound has benefited from improved risk sentiment this month as some countries consider reopening their economies, even as experts warn Britain may be on course to become the worst-affected country in Europe. It reached $1.26 in afternoon trading on Tuesday, its highest since March 13. But this optimism diminished on Wednesday, overtaken by fears about the toll on the global economy. On Tuesday, Britain’s budget forecasters said that the country’s economy could shrink as much as 13% this year due to the government’s coronavirus shutdown, its deepest recession in three centuries, with public borrowing set to surge to a post-World War Two high. MUFG’s Derek Halpenny said that whether financial markets can absorb the economic downturn without going into turmoil depends on lockdowns easing in time for a strong rebound in the third quarter this year. “More needs to be done on testing, in particular in the U.S. and the UK in order to reverse lockdowns during May,” he said.

5e5d08ee73d82f5acc8afcb7	RBA Leaves Rates Unchanged; Aussie bid	The RBA left rates unchanged yesterday at 0.75%, as expected. The labor market and strong housing market allowed the RBA to maintain rates (HIA New Home Sales (MoM) for DEC was 2% vs -2.5% expected before the RBA Meeting). Good economic data has given the RBA a luxury that most other Central Banks don’t have, time. As we discussed yesterday in the RBA Preview, the economic data was going to be the easy part of their decision. However, with new events since the last RBA meeting, the RBA needed to address how they would deal with them, if they needed to at all. Since the RBA meeting on December 3rd, 2019, the US-China trade deal was agreed to and signed, there were wildfires throughout Australia, and there was the development and spread of the Coronavirus. By leaving rates unchanged, the RBA can now see how these events will begin to unfold. Will the Coronavirus be contained? Will China have to cut demand? Will the wildfire stimulus economic growth? The Central Bank now has the luxury of time to see how these develop. In the accompanying statement, the RBA said they see a move perhaps in Q2. The markets viewed China’s measures to provide support and disaster relief for the Coronavirus as enough to begin putting risk back on. Combine that with the RBA’s decision to leave rates unchanged, and the Australian Dollar went bid as well. As we have been discussing, the AUD/USD has been sitting on support at .6670, which if broken, would have been lows not seen since 2009. The pair rallied off support and is currently trading at horizontal resistance near .6740. If the pair breaks through there, it can run up to .6800, which is the top trendline of the downward sloping channel from mid-2018. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com AUD/JPY is another pair which is rallying hard with the risk on move after bouncing from support. The pair had been in a rising wedge since mid-August 2019, before breaking lower on January 23rd, breaking the 200 Day Moving Average at 74.68. On January 27th, AUD/JPY gapped lower from 74.54 down to 74.18 on Coronavirus fears and traded down as low as 72.45. This level is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the lows on August 26th, 2019 to the highs on December 27th. Today, the pair bounced almost 1.5% to 73.75. Resistance is above at the gap and the 200 Day Moving average near 74.20/74.45. Support seems a mile below near the 72.45 level. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com It will be important to determine if there is follow through tomorrow from these moves higher in the Aussie pairs, or if this is going to just be another opportunity to sell the bounce. But with the RBA on hold, and if there is continued risk-on, Aussie pairs could remain bid!	AUD
5e81b5dcc496d2354de73002	Is the U.S dollar losing love?	Tuesday April 30: Five things the markets are talking about The Fed’s two-day policy meeting gets underway today. Officials are poised to keep interest rates steady when it concludes Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference will surely not want to be missed – will he be standing by his recent ‘dovish’ outlook? Currently, solid U.S growth and muted price measures continue to support the Fed’s holding stance. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the price index for personal-consumption expenditures, rose just +1.5% last month from March 2018. Ex-food and energy, core inflation was only slightly stronger at +1.6%, well below the Fed’s desired +2%. Global equities had been trading under pressure in the overnight session on reported disappointed earnings from Alphabet and Samsung, one day after new record high prints stateside. Both U.S treasuries’ and the ‘big’ dollar have found a small bid on the back of disappointed investors. Nevertheless, some positive Euro data ahead of the U.S open has managed to pare back some of euro-equities losses. This morning’s plethora of economic releases saw European data beat expectations on both the growth and inflation fronts (eurozone, Italian and Spanish GDP data; Italian unemployment, French, German, Spanish, Italian CPI readings). Note: Markets in Japan remain closed for Golden Week, reopens May 6, while a number of other countries are set to follow suit on May 1 (CNY, CHF, GER. Fr. & ITL). For now, various asset classes seem caught in the ‘twilight zone.’ Expect investors and dealers to continue to look for signals at the Feds policy meeting on Wednesday and earnings reports from the likes of Apple, GE and McDonald’s for some conviction. On the Sino-U.S trade front, the next round of trade talks are expected to get underway later today with significant issues still unresolved, but with enforcement mechanisms “close to done” according to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. On tap: CAD GDP, consumer confidence & NZD employment change (Apr 30), Bank holiday – CNY, CHF, GER. Fr. & ITL, U.S ISM manufacturing PMI, FOMC monetary policy statement & CNY Caixin manufacturing PMI (May 1), U.K inflation report, BoE monetary policy statement & AUD building approvals (May 2), non-farm payroll (May 3). 1. Stocks start to wobble Global equities have mostly edged down overnight after Wall Street hit a new high closing Monday, raising questions about how much longer the rally can continue while rising oil prices threaten to push inflation higher. Note: Tokyo’s Nikkei was closed for a public holiday, reopens May 6. Down-under, Aussie shares ended atop of their one-week low overnight as energy and mining stocks dropped sharply after disappointing factory data from China highlighted weakness in its economy. The S&P/ASX 200 index closed down -0.5%, after losing -0.4% yesterday. However, the index has advanced for a fourth consecutive month in April, gaining +2.3%. In S. Korea, the Kospi stock index ended lower, down -0.58%, also hit by disappointing China April factory growth. For the month, the Kospi has rallied +2.94%. In China, stocks rallied overnight despite lacklustre factory activity data. The blue-chip CSI300 index rose +0.3%, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained +0.5%. China April manufacturing PMI (OFFICIAL): 50.1 vs. 50.6E; Non-manufacturing PMI: 54.3 vs. 55.0e; Composite PMI: 53.4 v 54.0 prior. China April Caixin PMI manufacturing: 50.2 vs. 50.9E – however, export orders and employment back in contraction (below 50). Note: The China market will be closed starting tomorrow due to the Labour Day holidays, and will reopen on Monday, May 6. In Hong Kong, shares ended weaker overnight, hurt by declines in property and energy stocks, as the market awaits fresh stimulus after decent returns thus far in 2019. The Hang Seng index closed -0.7% lower at 29,699.11, while the China Enterprises Index ended down -0.8%. Note: The index will be closed on Wednesday for Labour Day holiday, and will resume trading on Thursday, May 2. In Europe, regional bourses trade mostly lower after mixed session in Asia and mixed U.S futures. U.S stocks are set to open in the ‘red’ (-0.6%). Indices: Stoxx600 -0.14% at 390.68, FTSE -0.14% at 7,430.25, DAX -0.10% at 12,315.72, CAC-40 -0.40% at 5,558.48, IBEX-35 -0.32% at 9,487.06, FTSE MIB +0.15% at 21,821.50, SMI +0.31% at 9,770.50, S&P 500 Futures -0.06% 2. Oil prices firm as Saudi’s says OPEC may extend supply cuts, gold higher Oil prices are better bid this morning after Saudi Arabia said a deal between producers to withhold output in 2019, year to date, could be extended beyond June to cover all of 2019. Saudi energy minister Khalid Al-Falih statement comes despite pressure by Trump directly insisting that OPEC raise output to make up for a supply shortfall expected from tightening U.S sanctions against Iran. Brent crude futures are at +$72.25 per barrel, up +21c, or +0.3c, from their last close. U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures are at +$63.67 per barrel, up +17c, or +0.3%, from Tuesday’s close. Despite a questionable global economy, oil prices have surged +40 ytd, supported mostly by supply cuts led by OPEC+ as well as by U.S sanctions on producers Iran and Venezuela and not necessarily by an increase in global demand. Consensus expect a balanced output for the remainder of this year – U.S sanctions are estimated to be counter balanced by an increase in production from OPEC+ and the U.S. Note: U.S. exports exceeded +3M bpd for the first time in early 2019 amid a more than +2M bpd production surge over the past year, to a record of more than +12M bpd. Ahead of the U.S open, gold prices have been small better bid as lacklustre Chinese factory activity data have renewed concerns about the health of the global economy. Spot gold has rallied +0.3% to +$1,283.44 per ounce, while U.S gold futures are up +0.3% at +$1,285.30 an ounce. Expect investors to wait for the Fed’s two-day policy meeting starting later this morning for clues on the interest rate outlook. 3. Eurozone bond yields little changed Euro government bond yields are little changed despite investor focus falling on economic growth and inflation numbers across the bloc’s biggest economies. Data this morning showed that France, the second largest in the eurozone, grew +0.3% in Q1, the third quarter in a row at that rate. It was in line with market expectations. Spain’s economy, the fourth biggest, expanded a stronger-than-expected +0.7% in Q1. This stronger data has helped to offset the weaker tone overnight from China, where readings on manufacturing activity failed to meet expectations. Germany’s 10-year Bund yield has pushed back through zero percent to trade at +0.002% but remains below the one-month highs hit earlier this month. Elsewhere, the yield on two-year Treasuries notes has fallen -2 bps to +2.27%, while the yield on 10-year Treasuries fell -1 bps to +2.51%. In Japan, the 10-year JGB yield is unchanged at -0.04%. 4. Dollar’s defining moment The ‘mighty’ USD is trading atop of its one-week lows against G10 currency pairs ahead of the U.S open. The greenback retreated from its recent cycle highs as US inflation data has been below expectations. Despite some of the negativity against the dollar, investors are content to continue buying U.S dollars on pullbacks. EUR/USD (€1.1212) has edged above the psychological €1.12 handle as a plethora of Euro economic releases beat expectations on both the growth and inflation fronts (Euro Zone, Italian and Spanish GDP data; Euro Zone, German, Italian unemployment; French, German, Spanish, Italian CPI readings all exceeded consensus). Rounding out the majors: USD/JPY at ¥111.31, lower by -0.2%; GBP/USD at £1.2989, higher by +0.4%; USD/CHF at $1.0180, lower by -0.1% Argentina’s central bank (BCRA) said it will step in to the FX market more readily to support the peso after several days of volatility last week sent the currency plunging outright. BCRA expects to sell dollars even if the exchange rate is stronger than 51.45 pesos to the dollar, which was the level the bank had previously set for interventions. The peso lost more than -5% of its value in one day last week. 5. Eurozone economic growth stronger than expected Data this morning showed that Eurozone economic growth was stronger than expected in the Q1, rebounding strongly from a slump in H2, 2018, while unemployment fell to its lowest rate in more than a decade. Eurostat said that according to a preliminary estimate, GDP in the 19 countries sharing the EUR rose +0.4% q/q in Q1, up from +0.2% in Q4 of 2018 and +0.1% in Q3. Year-on-year, eurozone GDP rose +1.2%. Note: Market expectations were looking for a +0.3% quarterly increase and a +1.1% annual expansion. Other data showed that eurozone unemployment fell to +7.7% in March vs. +7.8% in February. This article is for general information purposes only.

5e81b56cc496d2354de72fb8	Asia PMI’s A Mixed Bag, China Outperforms	We have had a veritable smorgasbord of Markit August PMI’s from across Asia released today, culminating with China’s Caixin August PMI, coming in higher at 50.4, back in expansion territory. It was in contrast to the pan-Asia PMI releases earlier today that all came in lower than expected. The China release has mollified the earlier negative sentiment in Asian markets with Shanghai slightly higher in opening trade. The divergence in results though will leave lingering worries that the positive China result was an aberration. Asia has a packed data calendar today before the week’s main events. We have rate decisions from Australia, Canada, Sweden and Europe on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, followed by the U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls on Friday. South Korea’s balance of trade for August showed a sharp deterioration to $1.72 billion this morning as did Japan’s capital spending for Q2. It plunged on a year-on-year basis to 1.90% against a consensus growth of 4.40%. Australia CommBank manufacturing PMI also disappointed at 50.90, continuing a grim run of data for the lucky country. It is, however, unlikely to swap the RBA into another rate cut tomorrow. The Labor Day holiday in the United States is unlikely to reduce volatility in Asia and Europe, with plenty of weekend news and upcoming event risk for markets to get their teeth into. The next round of U.S. tariffs on imported Chinese goods, totalling some $112.0 billion, kicked in over the weekend. The 15% tariffs are unlikely to be felt immediately by U.S. consumers, and financial markets are preferring a more optimistic view that the U.S. and China will get around the negotiating table this month. China’s attention was most likely on its stubbornly recalcitrant colony of Hong Kong over the weekend. Protests intensified once again after the arrest of some of the protest leaders. Police and protesters clashed in often violent confrontations, and once again the airport was severely disrupted. Markets are fretting on the increased likelihood of direct Chinese intervention and what that would mean for the future of one of Asia’s leading financial centres. The answer is, not good, to put it bluntly. The economic impact will surely show in Hong Kong data going forward and may temper the mood of equity traders in Asia as the new month begins. Elsewhere the major parties in Germany survived state elections mostly intact despite anti-immigration parties making some ground. It could boost the Euro slightly today. Argentina imposed currency controls over the weekend to stem capital flight in a development sure to weigh on Latam capital markets. In the U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has threatened expulsion from the party and the loss of the whip for Tory MP’s who refuse to tow the Brexit line. Not being whipped is usually a good thing I agree, but in this case, it means losing party affiliation and becoming in effect, a stateless independent within Parliament. Following on from protests against the suspension of Parliament over the weekend, it could add to pressures on the Sterling as the week begins. In summary, the commencement of the latest round of Trump tariffs on China will not be the main act today. The ongoing impact of the trade war on Asia and global growth though will be. The avalanche of tier one data and weather plus geopolitical turmoil ensures September volatility will begin as emotionally as August’s finished. Equities Month-end portfolio rebalancing flows dominated Wall Street on Friday with stocks giving up early gains despite U.S. personal expenditure data outperforming. The S&P 500 rose 0.05%, the Nasdaq fell 0.15% and the Dow Jones 0.15% giving a nil-all draw feel to the end of the week. The Japan Nikkei and Australian ASX were already showing initial weakness following underwhelming data releases by both this morning. With little direction from Wall Street, Asia will probably concentrate on the effects of U.S. tariffs and the ongoing political troubles in Hong Kong. Following a series of poor Markit PMI prints across the region today, The Caixin China PMI has lifted the gloom slightly as it printed an above consensus 50.4. The sentiment is likely to remain cautious in Asia, with the U.S. on holiday and so much political risk lingering. Currencies The Euro was the primary mover on Friday. The single currency fell 0.60%, sliding under 1.1000 to open at 1.0990 this morning. Traders shorting the Euro anticipating a significant cut or reintroduction of QE by the ECB on Thursday are likely to be disappointed. Looking at the price action on Friday, the move down had a month-end portfolio rebalancing look to it; thus, the sell-off should be taken with a grain of salt. More interesting will be if it can regain those losses this weak. With a Labor Day holiday today, traders preferred safety first, and the dollar index rose by a respectable 0.35% to 98.85. With a sense of nervousness hanging over Asia, the start of tariff-geddon part three, and a procession of negative news globally from the weekend, the U.S. dollar should remain firm. Haven currencies such as the Japanese Yen could outperform, with trade-sensitive currencies such as the Australian Dollar and regional Asian currencies most vulnerable to headlines or weak data during the session. Oil Crude oil fell on Friday as traders anticipated the landfall of Hurricane Dorian reducing demand for gasoline from Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. The hurricane has strengthened to a category five over the Bahama’s, and the uncertainty of its final path towards the United States should continue to weigh on futures markets. Brent crude fell 1.0 % to $60.50 a barrel with WTI bearing the brunt of the hurricane concerns, collapsing by 2.90% to $55.00 a barrel. Asia will be meteorologists today, with crude likely to fall if the path of Dorian marches towards Florida. Conversely, if Dorian is expected to miss the Florida panhandle and the Carolina’s, WTI in particular, could quickly recoup Friday’s losses. Gold Gold marked time on Friday as it awaited new developments on the trade front. Gold spot fell 0.30% to $1523.00 an ounce in subdued pre-holiday trading. Gold has already retraced those losses this morning, rising 0.60% to $1530.00 an ounce as Asian traders weigh up events in Hong Kong over the weekend. With heightened geopolitical risks aplenty to start the week, gold should find plenty of willing buyers looking to hedge risk on any dips in prices today.

5e8679c876a62a58a8b6b8af	Asia stocks little changed with oil prices mixed after record surge	Stocks in Asia were little changed on Friday following a record surge in oil prices overnight that saw U.S. crude futures soaring more than 24%. Mainland Chinese stocks were lower on the day, with the Shanghai composite down 0.6% to about 2,763.99 while the Shenzhen composite shed 0.47% to around 1,689.57. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dipped about 0.6%, as of its final hour of trading. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 closed largely flat at 17,820.19 while the Topix index ended its trading day 0.36% lower at 1,325.13. South Korea’s Kospi also closed just above the flatline at 1,725.44. Meanwhile, shares in Australia slipped, with the S&P/ASX 200 closing 1.68% lower at 5,067.50. Overall, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index shed 0.68%. The moves came after an overnight surge in oil prices. In the afternoon of Asian trading hours Friday, prices were oil prices were mixed, with international benchmark Brent crude futures recovering from their earlier slip to rise 1.47% to $30.38 per barrel. U.S. crude futures also fell 2.17% to $24.77 per barrel. Oil companies in Asia Pacific were mixed, with Australia’s Santos up 0.5% while Japan’s Inpex gained 2.63%. Hong Kong-listed shares of PetroChina, on the other hand, declined 5.56%. Thursday’s oil price surge came after U.S. President Donald Trump told CNBC’s Joe Kernen that he spoke to President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and expects them to announce an oil production cut of 10 million to 15 million barrels. Still, concerns over the economic impact of the global coronavirus pandemic likely lingered. On Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department said U.S. initial jobless claims surged to more than 6 million last week, reaching a new record as coronavirus-related shutdowns roll through the country. The U.S. labor market “has more or less collapsed in the past two weeks,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s Joseph Capurso wrote in a note, adding “it is only the beginning because more US states are applying lockdowns.” He said the data indicates the nonfarm payrolls report for April will likely indicate a “large jump in unemployment.” “Very large falls in US payrolls are coming in the following months, even if tonight’s report is stronger than expectations,” he said, referring to the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for March expected to be released later on Friday stateside. On the economic data front, a private survey released Friday showed China’s services sector shrank further in March. The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for March was at 43 following a record low of 26.5 in February, Reuters reported Friday. PMI readings below 50 indicate contraction, while figures above that level signify an expansion. “One of the good things … as an analyst, out of what’s happened the last few months is we now source all sorts of … alternative data to measure what’s going on in different economies so we’re less reliant on things like the PMI,” Richard Yetsenga, chief economist and head of research at ANZ, told CNBC’s “Street Signs” on Friday. Yetsenga said indicators such as coastal ship volumes and traffic congestion show China is “trying to gradually normalize” its economy. Still, he added: “The pace of improvement is much, much slower than the pace of slowdown through January and into February and China’s probably still only back to 75% of normal capacity.” Investors have been watching data releases out of China for clues on the economic impact of the coronavirus. The first reported cases came out of the country, and authorities imposed measures such as an extended holiday period to prevent the disease’s spread. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was last at 100.333 after crossing the 100 barrier yesterday. The Japanese yen traded at 108.07 per dollar after an earlier high of 107.79. The Australian dollar changed hands at $0.6049 after seeing levels above $0.612 earlier in the week. — CNBC’s Fred Imbert contributed to this report.	EQUITY
5e5d0901bd5d9d5ac072761d	US Dollar Price Action Setups: EUR/USD, USD/CAD, USD/JPY	Continuing our theme from Tuesday, a number of peculiarities have continued to show across global markets; and perhaps this is but a coincidental occurrence or, perhaps something larger is afoot in the risk trade but, at this point, a quick rush of selling showed up in US equity indices. This comes just after yesterday’s massive breakout in USD/JPY which, itself, tracks a strong bullish breakout in Gold. All of this is happening as the US Dollar pushes up to fresh three-year-highs as US Treasury yields tick back down to 2020 lows. Suffice it to say, caution is warranted. But, as usual, the game must go on and setups remain around the US Dollar in a variety of venues that were looked at in this webinar. USD on Tradingview I had looked into this one on Tuesday and a similar backdrop remained today. Price action in EUR/USD has begun to fill the gap from April of 2017 but, ominously sellers have been unable to break much fresh ground. The 1.0814 Fibonacci level did come in as short-term resistance but, as yet, sellers haven’t been able to substantiate much run beyond prior lows. At this point, the item of attraction would appear to be the potential for a Friday pullback ahead of the weekend that could, possibly, allow for short-side trend strategies to come back into play. Levels around 1.0863, 1.0890 or perhaps even 1.0925 could remain of interest for as such. Outside of that, the big zone of prior support around the 1.1000 psychological level hasn’t yet been tested for resistance, and this could be a workable item should a stronger rally begin to show. EUR/USD on Tradingview At this stage, a deduction of drivers would suggest that fear of Japanese recessionary pressure is pushing in a frame of Yen-weakness. There was a nasty machine orders data release a couple of days ago, just ahead of the USD/JPY breakout, so that syncs up. There’s also the fear of a greater risk due to Coronavirus spread, so perhaps this is just a potent cocktail of fear meshing up with bad data, creating a significant market move. But, at this stage, the prior safe-haven scenario that I was looking at for Yen-strength is no longer workable nor attractive, so its time to adapt. From the USD/JPY chart, if additional stretch does show – there’s short-side potential; taken from a resistance zone that capped the 2019 swing high, taken from around the 112.50 psychological level. USD/JPY on Tradingview I had looked into this one earlier today as there’s a workable scenario on either side of the equation. Longer-term, bearish swing potential remains as prices have held resistance around the November swing-high. Shorter-term, however, and there would be a few factors of strength in consideration, key of which has been the build of a falling wedge after that resistance test, coupled with the inclusion of support as taken from the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the 2018-2019 major move in the pair.

5e8cf2ce4186c512f2988f5c	Is the Dow staging a genuine rebound? Here’s what experts think as the stock market attempts to shake the bearish grip of the coronavirus pandemic	Investors are seeing light at the end of the tunnel after a brutal period. But is it an oncoming train? It’s a question many investors are weighing as the market attempts a powerful rebound from its late-March lows on the back of signs that the spread of the coronavirus-borne disease COVID-19 could be slowing here and elsewhere in the world. Some of the hardest-hit places in the U.S., where a quarter of all confirmed global cases have now been reported, are starting to show welcome signs of a reduction in infections, including New York state, which has emerged as the epicenter of the viral outbreak that began in Wuhan, China in December. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, speaking during a news conference on Tuesday, said that the rate of hospitalizations is plateauing, even as he reported the biggest one-day rise in deaths. Italy and Spain also have reported a slowdown in the outbreak following strict social-distancing and lockdown measures, and Austria and Denmark are setting the stage for a return to some semblance of normalcy. Wuhan, China, where the disease was first identified, reported no new deaths for the first time since January. See:Vodka, saunas and resisting lockdown — the countries taking a different approach to the coronavirus “We are finally seeing U.S. COVID-19 new case numbers responding to social distancing — certainly in New York state but also elsewhere,” wrote analysts at BofA Global Research in a note. On top of that, central banks and governments across the globe are throwing out what amounts to trillions of dollars to help stanch the economic damage resulting from efforts to mitigate infections and treat those sickened by the illness derived from the novel strain of coronavirus. Those factors have given a major boost to equities and momentarily deflated some of the rabid appetite for assets considered havens like the 10-year Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.746%. The 10-year yields about 0.78%, compared with 0.587% on Friday. Bond prices fall as yields rise. And stocks, attempted strong gains Tuesday before ending lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +3.44% giving up a more than 930-point rally, after a dramatic surge on Monday saw the blue-chip index, along with the S&P 500 index SPX, +3.40% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +2.58%, close more than 7% higher. See:Why skeptics believe a V-shaped Dow rebound remains unlikely to materialize As of Tuesday, the Dow is already up 7.6% on the week (which is set to be abbreviated by a Good Friday market pause), the S&P 500 is 6.9% higher, and the Nasdaq is on pace for a gain of 7%. From recent lows on March 23, the Dow has risen about 19.4%, the S&P 500 is up roughly 17% and the Nasdaq has gained nearly 14.3%. It has been an extraordinary move higher, and the rate of infections and the latest death tolls appear set to continue catalyzing market moves in the near term. Why? Because those data will signal when the economy, which has been mostly in shutdown mode since the pandemic took hold, could possibly resume. The swing higher for stocks has created a degree of discord among experts about how this movement will ultimately play out for markets in the near term as investors process likely poor economic data and weak corporate earnings in the days ahead. Some argue that the bottom has been put in, but others are worried that the market could retest its March lows. The team at Wolfe Research, including chief investment strategist Chris Senyek, says it has remained bearish on the market, given the weak data outlook. The disease’s path, the team wrote in a Tuesday report, is an uncertain one, “and our sense [is] that incoming economic data [and first-quarter] earnings season will be very disappointing.” “We don’t believe that the global COVID-19 crisis is out of the woods just yet,” wrote the Wolfe Research team, with its analysts adding that they worry about infections remaining “very high” and the possibility of re-acceleration in places including Louisiana and New Jersey. “How bad will it ultimately get and when will overall new infection rates peak? We do not know — but, from an investment perspective, that’s the key point,” the team wrote. “We don’t believe that U.S. equity markets will find a sustainable bottom until the U.S. new infection rate definitively rolls over.” Indeed, perceived improvements in the public health situation and in risk appetite may not justify current stock-market valuations for some bears, especially as corporate quarterly results are expected to provide an ugly reminder of the impact of the virus. J.P.Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +4.03% CEO Jamie Dimon warned on Monday said that earnings for the nation's largest bank by assets will decline “meaningfully” in 2020 from last year’s $36.4 billion, citing the impact from coronavirus. Read: Wall Street star money manager says S&P 500 could plunge to 1,500 in worst case, with coronavirus fallout lingering for year David Kostin, chief equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, estimated that dividends will be down 25% and buybacks, one of the key supports for the market over the past decade, will be off 50%. He told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that dividends are “becoming more prized.” Also read:Goldman analyst who predicted the coronavirus would kill the bull market says ‘risk to the downside is greater’ despite Dow’s recent rally “From a sentiment angle, recent exceptional bounces suggest that investor sentiment is still in the denial phase, rather than in the phase of capitulation that paves the way for a new bull market,” wrote Peter van der Welle, multiasset strategist at Robeco. Albert Edwards, global strategist at Société Générale, on Tuesday said that investor hopes may be tied to monetary and fiscal relief measures, but that their hopes could be misplaced: “This optimism is the legacy of a long bull market. Investors can’t conceive that the Fed will ‘allow’ the stock market to collapse,” the analysts tweeted on Tuesday, adding: “Think again.” That said, Michael Wilson, Morgan Stanley’s chief equity strategist, said in a recent note that he believes the recent stock-market lows won’t be retested, even as he said he’s forecasting earnings to decline 20%. He said there will be value opportunities for investors. David Kostin says bullishness for the stocks don’t necessarily signify an all -clear sign for investors looking for a path higher for a coronavirus-stricken market.

5e5d091973d82f5acc8afd04	USD/MXN Nearing Levels Not Seen Since 2018	"USD/MXN has been in a symmetrical triangle since April 2018. We have patiently been waiting to see which way it would break out as price approached the apex of the triangle. As rumors began to swirl that the United State-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) could be ratified by congress, the Mexican Peso began to strengthen. The strong bid in US stocks as also helped the commodity currency to go bid. Even in the face of the Central Bank of Mexico lowering rates to 7.25% (4th straight meeting the Central Bank has cut), the currency still is strong! The USD/MXN finally broker lower out of the triangle on December 11th, 2019 and is currently hitting lows not seen since October 1st, 2018, below 18.7300. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com As price was breaking lower from the triangle, it formed a new downward sloping channel. Notice that as price is moving lower, it is in the middle of that channel, so there is still room left on the downside. But also notice that for the moment, price is diverging with the RSI, indicating we may see a reversal soon. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com On a 240-minute time-frame, we get a closer look of price breaking the October 2018 lows (green line) at near 18.7500. However, as with the daily time-frame, USD/MXN is diverging with the RSI. In addition, the pair is running into trendline support from the downward sloping channel it has been in since December 12th. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Resistance comes in above at the top channel trendline on the 240-minute chart near 18.9000. Above that, also on the 240-minute chart, is horizontal resistance and prior highs near 18.9750. If price breaks above there, there is a large confluence of resistance levels between 19.2000 and 19.3000 (see daily chart above), which includes the 200 Day Moving Average, the downward recent downward sloping trendline (green) and the long-term upward sloping trendline. First support comes across on the 240-minute chart at the lower channel of the trendline, just below current levels, near 18.6850. Next support is near 18.40 on the daily timeframe, which is a confluence on the daily of the downward sloping trendline (green) and horizontal support. Next Thursday, inflation data for Mexico is going to be released (2.9% expected). If inflation is weaker than expected, will USD/MXN bounce? The USMCA is sitting on President Trump's desk waiting to be signed. Will there be a ""buy the rumor, sell the fact""? Will the near-term channel support hold? Will we see a bounce given the RSI divergence on both the daily and 240-minute timeframe? Possibly. However, being aware of important levels where price action may change is a major part of pre-trade analysis."	MXN

Robert Kiyosaki, the best-selling author of “Rich Dad, Poor Dad,” offered this bit of advice to his 1.3 million followers on Twitter TWTR, +2.72% for when that cash finally arrives: Yes, instead of stashing away your check, Kiyosaki says load up on bitcoin BTCUSD, , gold GC00, -0.84% and silver SI00, +0.89% in the face of the dying dollar DXY, -0.71% . Read:Will you get a $1,200 from the stimulus bill? Depends on how much you make This has been a theme on Kiyosaki’s social channels for awhile and has taken on an added urgency as the coronavirus pandemic continues to weigh heavily on the stock market: And here’s a recent episode on his YouTube channel that’s racked up more than half a million views: Gold’s been a relatively great place to be over the past three months, having rallied more than 5% as the Dow DJIA, -0.11% plunged into bear-market territory. Silver and bitcoin, not so much, with both posting double-digit percentage declines over that same period of time. Kiyosaki has been pushing silver, which he hails as the “best buy,” for a while now. Earlier this year, he told Kitco News he won’t stop buying silver until it tops $40 an ounce — it currently sits below $15. “Silver is the most undervalued, lowest-risk, best investment of all asset classes,” he said. Also read:Robert Kiyosaki says this is ‘the only rule’ for getting and staying rich The latest U.S. government data shows the retail industry lost 46,200 jobs in March to furloughs and layoffs, but the cuts will be much deeper as the crisis wears on, research from the National Retail Federation shows.

5e95746626a6247477d300b2	USD/CAD struggles near 1-month lows, below 1.3900 mark	The greenback remained on the defensive against its Canadian counterpart, with the USD/CAD pair struggling below the 1.3900 mark, or near one-month lows. The US dollar failed to gain any meaningful traction despite a goodish pickup in the US Treasury bond yields, which was eventually seen as one of the key factors exerting some pressure for the fourth consecutive session on Tuesday. The downtick also marked the sixth day of a negative move in the previous seven and seemed rather unaffected by a weaker tone surrounding crude oil prices, which tend to undermine demand for the commodity-linked – the loonie. The latest optimism over a 9.7 million-barrel cut in daily oil production by OPEC+ turned out to be short-lived amid concerns over an unprecedented demand loss from the global COVID-19 disaster and led to some renewed weakness in oil prices. Bulls, however, seemed rather unimpressed, instead preferred to wait on the sidelines and assess the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy, which will continue to play a key role in influencing the market sentiment. There isn't any major market-moving economic data due for releases on Tuesday. Hence, the USD/oil price dynamics will be looked upon for a fresh impetus and grab some meaningful trading opportunities.	CAD
5e94d9c2870fd55289f2c154	Saudi Energy Minister: effective global oil cuts above 19 million bpd – Reuters	As per Reuters, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister said on Monday that effective global oil supply cuts would amount to around 19.5 million barrels per day (bpd), taking into account the reduction pact agreed by OPEC+, pledges by other G20 nations and oil purchases into reserves. OPEC+ said it had agreed to reduce output by 9.7 million bpd for May and June, after four days of talks and following pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to arrest the oil price decline. Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told reporters via a conference call that G20 nations outside the OPEC+ alliance had pledged to cut about 3.7 million bpd of oil supply, while oil purchases into reserves (SPRs) were seen at 200 million barrels over the next couple of months, according to the IEA. Prince Abdulaziz also said the kingdom could cut oil output below its current quota of 8.5 million bpd if there was a need by the market over the coming months and if any reductions were done collectively with other producers on a pro-rata basis. OPEC+ meets next in June via teleconference to decide on output policy. Due to the closing hours of the US settlement, oil prices fail to provide a much reaction to the news. However, it did bounce from $22.20 at the last minutes.	ENERGY
5e873c2adce5be0df5cdb386	Dollar Gains Strength Ahead Of NFP	EZ PMIs sink All eyes on NFPs Nikkei -0.01% Dax -0.57% UST 10-Year 0.61% Oil $25/bbl Gold $1611/oz BTCUSD $6915 Asia and the EU EUR Markit PMI 29.7 vs. 31.4 North America Open USD NFP 08:430 USD ISM Non-Manufacturing 10:00 It was another risk-off day in global financial markets as renewed COVID-19 concerns and horrid financial data from the Eurozone weighed on investor sentiment in Asian and early European session. Singapore which has been hailed as an exemplar state in handling the coronavirus pandemic suddenly announced a near full closure of all activity as case count spiked despite extensive test and trace controls that have been in effect since February. The news showed just how intractable the pandemic problem has become even for the most efficient and effective state actors to handle. COVID-19 case count has now reached the 1 million mark with more than 50,000 deaths and shows few signs of abating. The near cessation of all economic activity was acutely visible in the Eurozone numbers which saw the composite PMI print at 29.7 vs. 31.4 eyed. The Europeans still can’t come to terms on a joint fiscal response to the crisis with Germany reportedly opposed to the issue of “corona bonds” which would expose them to sovereign risk. The tensions in the region show no signs of abating and EURUSD is feeling the pain as it dropped below the 1.0800 figure in early European dealing. For now, the economic state of global affairs is in such disarray that the EURUSD may tread water at current levels in an uneasy sense of equilibrium. But as soon as pandemic conditions improve, the much more forceful US fiscal response will likely send the euro much lower as the economic disparity between the two regions becomes evident. Meanwhile, all eyes today will focus on US NFP data which is forecast to print negative for the first time in more than 100 months. The March reading is unlikely to catch the full extent of job losses due to COVID-19 so the market may take the data with a grain of salt, but if the number it less than 200K it could provide some room for a relief rally. On the other hand, a truly gargantuan print of -500K job losses or more could drive risk assets sharply lower as the day proceeds with both S&P 500 and Nasdaq falling 5% or more.	USD
5e5d07c12e1fe5553d2b6373	The RBNZ Gives the Kiwi a Boost ahead as the Focus Shifts to the EUR and USD	It was a busy day on the Asian economic calendar this morning. The Kiwi Dollar and the Aussie Dollar were in action in the early part of the day. Key stats included the electronic credit card retail sales figures out of New Zealand and consumer confidence figures out of Australia, On the monetary policy front, the RBNZ was also in action, delivering its first monetary policy decision of the year. Electronic card retail sales fell by 0.1% in January, following on from a 0.9% decline in December. Economists had forecast a 1% rise. According to NZ Stats, The Kiwi Dollar moved from $0.64020 to $0.64017 upon release of the figures that preceded the RBNZ policy decision and press conference. The RBNZ held rates unchanged at 1% this morning, which was in line with expectations. Salient points from the Rate Statement included: The Kiwi Dollar moved from $0.64118 to $0.64580 upon release of the rate statement and monetary policy statement. At the time of writing, the Kiwi Dollar was up by 0.87% to $0.6462. Next up is the RBNZ Press Conference… The Westpac Consumer Sentiment Index jumped by 2.3% to 95.5 in February. In January, the index had fallen by 1.8% to 93.4. Economists had forecast a more modest 1.4% rise. According to the latest Westpac Report, The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.67173 to $0.67202 upon release of the stats. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was up by 0.19% to $0.6727. At the time of writing, the Japanese Yen was down by 0.05% to ¥109.84 against the U.S Dollar. It’s a relatively quiet day ahead on the economic calendar. Industrial production figures are due out of the Eurozone later today. Following some particularly disappointing production numbers out of France, Germany, and Italy, today’s figure will need to be particularly dire to move the dial. Expectations are for production to fall by 1.5% in December, so expect the EUR to soften on any weaker numbers. Outside of the stats, geopolitical risk is on the rise once more. Tensions return in Italy, with the Irish election result also raising some uncertainty. Things are not much better in Germany, as Merkel’s CDU Party sees Merkel’s chosen successor resign. Expect chatter from Italy and Germany to garner plenty of attention. The last thing the EU needs is discord as it prepares to negotiate with Britain on trade. At the time of writing, the EUR was up by 0.02% to $1.0918. It’s a particularly quiet day ahead on the economic calendar, with no material stats due out of the UK to provide direction. Economic data from the UK on Tuesday appeared to vindicate MPC members who decided to vote in favor of a hold on interest rates. The UK managed to avoid an economic contraction, in spite of soft manufacturing and industrial production at the end of the year. Hopes are that Johnson’s landslide victory will deliver a near-term boost to growth ahead of next month’s budget. Whether the Pound can hold onto $1.29 levels and eye a return to $1.30 levels remains to be seen, however. Much will depend on how the government progresses with key trading partners on trade talks. At the time of writing, the Pound was up by 0.07% to $1.2961. It’s a quiet day ahead on the data front, with no material stats due out later today to provide the Greenback with direction. The lack of stats will leave FED Chair Powell and his 2nd day of testimony in focus. At the time of writing, the Dollar Spot Index was up by 0.04% to 98.765. It’s a quiet day ahead on the economic calendar. There are no material stats due out of Canada to provide the Loonie with direction. Crude oil prices will influence on the day, with OPEC’s monthly report and the weekly IEA numbers due out later today. The Loonie was up by 0.01% at C$1.3285 against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing.	NZD
5e5d092cbd5d9d5ac0727662	Australian Dollar Remains on Virus Watch As Key Jobs Data Loom	The Australian Dollar is like all other major traded assets in thrall to the ups and downs of the coronavirus story. It’s likely to remain so in the week ahead, although there are a couple of important domestic data points which will also offer the prospect of major market moves of their own. The currency perked up in the past week when investors thought the infection rate might be slowing, only to struggle when reports showed cases surging in China’s Hubei province thanks to new diagnosis methods. There are signs however that Australian markets have a degree of underlying resilience and that even this serious contagion has not yet quite erased the optimism with which growth-correlated currencies like the Aussie started the year. AUD/USD has managed a clear bounce from its recent lows even though sentiment clearly remains fragile. Moreover, worries about Chinese demand have already hit commodity prices, and with Australia as a major supplier, the Australian Dollar faces clear headwinds, exacerbated by expectations that domestic interest rates will head further down yet from their current record lows. The markets might get a big clue about that on Thursday when official Australian employment data for January are due. December saw a major rise in the headline job creation of nearly 30,000. That was well ahead of expectations. However, impressive though they were, those gains were confined entirely to the part-time sector with full time roles contracting. Expect this split to be watched very closely when the numbers are released. The minutes of February 4’s monetary policy meeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia are coming up on Tuesday. The Official Cash Rate remained on hold at 0.75% back then, and Governor Philip Lowe has since struck a relatively upbeat note on economic prospects. The minutes are likely to back this up, but investors may want to make sure there are no new angles. All up its unlikely that even relatively upbeat domestic data are going to keep traders from virus-headline watching for very long. That makes a macro forecast extremely tricky, but assuming no dramatic ramp-up of infection rates the Aussie may be able to hang on to its recent modest gains. It’s a neutral call this week.

5e5d07dc2e1fe5553d2b638b	China’s Economy Holds Steady as Focus Shifts to the GBP and the USD	It was a busy day on the Asian economic calendar this morning. Stats included Business PMI numbers for New Zealand and 4th quarter GDP and December industrial production numbers out of China. While the numbers provided direction, particularly the stats out of China, the talk of tariffs being removed in stages over the year added support early on. The Business NZ PMI fell from 51.4 to 49.3 in December, which followed on from a fall from 52.6 to 51.4 in November. The Kiwi Dollar moved from $0.66402 to $0.66335 upon release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Kiwi Dollar up by 0.02% to $0.6639. Fixed asset investments rose by 5.4%, year-on-year, in December, picking up from a 5.2% increase in November. Economists had forecast a 5.2% increase. Industrial production rose by 6.9%, year-on-year, in December, coming in ahead of a forecasted 5.9% increase. In November industrial production had risen by 6.2%. Retail sales increased by 8% in December, which was in line with November numbers, while ahead of a forecasted 7.8% rise. Year-on-year, the economy grew by 6.0% which was in line with forecasts. The economy had grown by 6.0% in the 3rd quarter. Quarter-on-quarter, the economy grew by 1.5%, which was also in line with forecasts and the 3rd quarter. The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.68924 to $0.68993 upon release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was up by 0.06% to $0.6902. At the time of writing, the Japanese Yen was down by 0.04% to ¥110.20 against the greenback. It’s a relatively quiet day ahead on the economic calendar, with finalized inflation figures for December due out of Italy and the Eurozone. Barring deviation from prelim, the Eurozone’s month-on-month figures will likely have the greatest influence. Outside of the numbers, we can expect sentiment towards trade to also provide direction on the day. When looking at the economic indicators from the U.S and the Eurozone and factoring in the phase 1 trade agreement, the upside for the EUR will likely be limited. At the time of writing, the EUR was up by 0.01% to $1.1138. It’s a relatively busy day ahead on the economic calendar, with December retail sales figures due out of the UK. Economic data from earlier in the week had been particularly disappointing yet the Pound has managed to hold its ground. Boris Johnson’s victory and an improved political environment continue to prop up the Pound. Forecasts are Sterling positive. At the time of writing, the Pound was down by 0.09% to $1.3068. It’s another busy day on the data front. Key stats include December’s industrial production and housing sector figures and January consumer sentiment numbers. Following December’s disappointing NFP numbers, November’s JOLTs job opening figures will also have an influence on the day. On the geopolitical front, with the phase 1 trade agreement out of the way, impeachment chatter has picked up. The impeachment trial began on Thursday and is expected to hit full speed next week. While we can expect plenty of news, the fact that Trump is unlikely to be ousted by his own party leaves the markets in a calm state. The Dollar Spot Index was down by 0.01% to 97.307 at the time of writing. It’s another quiet day on the economic calendar, with economic data limited to November foreign securities purchases. With the Bank of Canada’s first monetary policy decision due next week, there’s been little to influence in the week. The USMCA and a phase 1 trade agreement between the U.S and China should be enough to provide support on the day. From earlier in the day, economic data out of China should also provide support, with GDP numbers holding steady and industrial production on the bounce. The Loonie was down by 0.01% at C$1.3043 against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing.	NZD
5e8cba9a2baefd6cf876b369	GBP/USD: Here’s Why 1.2500 Holds Key For More Upsides	Looking at the 4-hours chart, the pair broke many hurdles near 1.2305 and settled above the 100 simple moving average (red, 4-hours). Besides, there was a break above the 50% Fib retracement level of the main decline from the 1.3200 high to 1.1409 low. However, the pair struggled to climb further above the 1.2500 resistance area and the 200 simple moving average (green, 4-hours). It seems like the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the main decline from the 1.3200 high to 1.1409 low is acting as a strong barrier for the bulls. Therefore, a successful break above the 1.2500 resistance zone is must for more upsides. If not, the pair could start a fresh decline below the 1.2100 support area. Recently, there was a break below a contracting triangle with support near 1.2380 on the same chart. It has opened the doors for more downsides, but the 1.2100 support is very important. A successful break below the 1.2100 support and the 100 SMA may perhaps push GBP/USD below 1.2000 and 1.1980.	GBP

5e95bbf64123db6725a97b85	Gold Price Analysis: Path of least resistance remains to the upside after topping $1,730 – Confluence Detector	After hitting new seven-year highs, the gold price has continued advancing and has topped $1,730. What are the next targets for precious metal? The Federal Reserve's massive printing and the return of traders after Easter are behind the upside move. A quick look already reveals that XAU/USD has stronger support than resistance. The Technical Confluences Indicator is showing that minor resistance awaits at $1,731, which is the meeting point of the most recent high and the Pivot Point one-day Resistance 1. It is followed by $1,742, which is a major hurdle – where the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 2 hits the price. The next level is $1,749, which is when yet another Pivot Pointe, the one-day R2, is seen. Strong support awaits at $1,728 – the previous target – which is the convergence of the Bollinger Band one-day Upper, the previous 4h-high, and the Simple Moving Average 5-15m. This cluster of support stands out on the chart and is more robust than the resistance lines mentioned beforehand. Further down, at $1,724, the previous daily high, the SAM 5-1h, and the BB 15min-Middle all meet. The next considerable cushion is at $1,714, which is the confluence of the Fibonacci 23.6% one-day and the PP one-week R1. Here is how it looks on the tool: The Confluence Detector finds exciting opportunities using Technical Confluences. The TC is a tool to locate and point out those price levels where there is a congestion of indicators, moving averages, Fibonacci levels, Pivot Points, etc. Knowing where these congestion points are located is very useful for the trader, and can be used as a basis for different strategies. This tool assigns a certain amount of “weight” to each indicator, and this “weight” can influence adjacents price levels. These weightings mean that one price level without any indicator or moving average but under the influence of two “strongly weighted” levels accumulate more resistance than their neighbors. In these cases, the tool signals resistance in apparently empty areas. Learn more about Technical Confluence	METAL
5e81b610c496d2354de73049	Be prepared, it’s an action-packed week in capital markets	Monday January 28: Five things the markets are talking about Global equities start the week on the back foot, as capital markets weigh political developments, from Sino-U.S trade to Brexit, against U.S corporate earnings, that have to date, surpassed many analysts expectations, and this despite ongoing signs of a global economic slowdown. This is expected to be an action-packed week amongst the various asset classes where investors will face some key tests – Chinese President Xi’s top economic aide, Vice-Premier Liu He, will meet with Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday and Thursday. There’s the U.S governments ongoing talks on border security and tomorrow, the U.K parliament is expected to vote on amendments to PM Theresa May’s Brexit deal with the E.U. On Wednesday, the E.U Parliament will debate Brexit. Also Wednesday, investors will be digesting the Fed’s latest monetary policy meeting outcome. If the Fed is to be keep their views unchanged this week, it should maintain a “cautiously friendly environment” for risk assets. The market has priced in ‘no’ rate hikes stateside in 2019. Fed Chair Powell will hold a news conference after the FOMC rate decision. While on Friday, the granddaddy of U.S economic indicators will be delivered – U.S non-farm payrolls (NFP). Also, in the background there is a slew of corporate earning’s announcements – Tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Alibaba, SAP, Qualcomm, Tesla, Samsung and Sony announce earnings. 1. Stocks see red In Japan, the Nikkei fell overnight as a stronger yen (¥109.35) weighed on the broader market, however, losses were limited as investors remain reluctant to enter into larger positions ahead of Q3 corporate earnings reports this week. At the close the Nikkei share average dropped -0.6%, while the broader Topix shed -0.7% with 32 of the 33 subsectors in the red. Down-under, Australia was closed for a bank holiday. In S. Korea, the Kospi stock index ended little changed overnight amid investor caution ahead of the FOMC rate decision and Sino-U.S trade talks. The index settled largely unchanged at -0.02%. In China, equities ended lower on Monday as downbeat industrial profit and weaker GDP data last week reinforced concerns about a slowing economy and this despite the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) freeing up a potential +$37B for bank lending and while a new CEO was named to lead the country’s main securities regulator. At the close, the Shanghai Composite index was down -0.18%, while the blue-chip CSI300 index was down -0.02%. In Hong Kong, it was a similar story, the Hang Seng index ended nearly flat, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises index inched up +0.1%. In Europe, regional bourses trade lower across the board after a lower session in Asia and lower U.S futures as the U.S Government again opens fully for business after 35-days. U.S stocks are set to open down (-0.44%). Indices: Stoxx600 -0.18% at 357.18, FTSE -0.05% at 6,805.96, DAX -0.09% at 11,271.65, CAC-40 -0.28% at 4,912.01, IBEX-35 -0.03% at 9,182.35, FTSE MIB -0.20% at 19,770.50, SMI -0.33% at 8,897.00, S&P 500 Futures -0.44% 2. Oil falls on U.S rig count and weaker China data, gold higher Ahead of the U.S open, oil prices are under pressure, down over -1% after data from Friday showed that U.S companies added rigs for the first time this year, a sign that crude output may rise further, and as China reported additional signs of an economic slowdown. Brent crude oil futures are at +$60.74 a barrel, down -90c, or -1.46%, while U.S crude oil futures are at +$52.84 per barrel, down -85c, or -1.58%, from Friday’s close. A higher U.S production rate continues to eat away at OPEC+’s efforts to support crude prices. U.S crude oil production rose to a record +11.9M bpd in Q4 2018 and there is evidence that U.S production rates will increase further, especially when you see data from Baker-Hughes showing that U.S energy firms raised the number of rigs looking for new oil for the first time this year to +862 – an addition of 10 rigs. The U.S is now the world’s largest oil producer. A global economic slowdown supported by a persistent weakness in Chinese data and egged on by a trade dispute between U.S and China is also weighing on fuel demand-growth expectations. China is trying to stem the slowdown with aggressive fiscal stimulus measures, however, there are concerns that these efforts may not have the desired effect as China’s economy is already burdened with massive debt. Gold prices are trading atop of their seven-month peak, on hopes that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged during its two-day policy meeting this week. Spot gold is a tad lower at +$1,301.81 per ounce, while U.S gold futures have rallied +0.2% to +$1,300 per ounce. Note: The Fed meets between Jan. 29 and Jan. 30, and Chairman Powell is expected to “acknowledge growing risks to the U.S economy as global momentum weakens.” 3. Eurozone bond yields expected to remain near month lows Eurozone sovereign bond yields are expected to remain within striking distance of this month’s lows as a number of factors should be supportive of lower yields this week – ECB speakers are expected to deliver ‘dovish’ rhetoric, aided by the the Brexit vote, Wednesday’s FOMC decision, global mixed data and month-end index flows – these are all reasons enough to keep eurozone government bond yields atop of their two-year lows. The slowdown in the eurozone’s economic growth is especially supportive of German Bunds – the 10-year Bund yield trades unchanged at +0.14% – coupled with last week’s decline in January PMI’s/Ifo is proof that investors should not be expecting an economic revival in the near-term. Elsewhere, the yield on 10-year Treasuries have declined -1 bps to +2.75%, while in the U.K, the 10-year Gilt yield was unchanged at +1.317%. 4. Dollar under pressure This is a very sensitive geo-political week for the FX market, with China-U.S trade talks, the Brexit vote, FOMC rhetoric, NFP and corporate earnings, the U.S investor should expect some nervous price moves to occur at inconvenient times with little liquidity. The markets focus on Wednesday will be the Fed’s rate decision with dealers expecting the Fed to maintain the cautiously friendly environment for risk assets which has been the main trait in January so far. GBP/USD (£1.3180) is a tad softer by -0.2% ahead of tomorrow’s U.K parliamentary vote on Brexit. The key focus will be on the possible “amendments” to PM May’s Brexit deal. Currently there were two rival visions that sought to take control of the Brexit process. An extension of Article 50 appears the be the most likely outcome in the current process. EUR/USD (€1.1419) is little changed and is expected to continue to trade between €1.13 and €1.15 in the near term as concerns about the U.S economy and Fed’s policy offset eurozone economic weakness, which should curtail most dollar gains and the ‘single unit’s’ losses. The Fed is likely to reaffirm “patience on rates and its data dependency,” even as U.S Q4 GDP data is expected to highlight a stronger U.S economy. 5. Eurozone bank lending stable last month Data from the ECB this morning showed that Bank lending to businesses and households in the eurozone was stable in December. Lending to “non-financial” corporations grew at an annual rate of +4% m/m and was unchanged from the previous month. Lending to eurozone “households” was also steady, growing at an annual rate of +3.3% in December. Note: The eurozone economy is heavily dependent on the availability of funding. However, lending rates have remained well below the pre-crisis levels. In 2007 and in H1 of 2008, bank lending to businesses was running at rates well above +12%.

5e5d31b7d3c8fc0aa1ab81de	EUR/USD: Elliott Wave Analysis And Forecast For 28/02/2020 – 06/03/2020	The pair EUR/USD remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a level of 1.0866. Main scenario: long positions should be considered from corrections above the level of 1.0866 with a target of 1.1240 – 1.1400. Alternative scenario: breakout and consolidation below the level of 1.0866 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.0780 – 1.0700 Analysis: Supposedly, a descending correction of senior level finished developing in the form of the second wave 2 on the daily time frame, with wave C of 2 completed within. Supposedly, the fifth wave 5 of (C) has finished developing and wave 1 of (1) of 3 started forming on the H4 time frame. Apparently, the first counter-trend wave of junior level i of 1 is forming on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to 1.1240 – 1.1400 once local correction ii of 1 is over. The level 1.0866 is critical in this scenario.	USD
5e79e9d8104b2d72c04b83c8	Battered sterling wins a respite for time being	LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s pound rallied over 1.5% against the dollar on Tuesday, set for its biggest daily jump since October, winning a respite from a battering in recent days in the face of the coronavirus. Sterling, along with most currencies, has seen a massive wave of selling against the U.S. dollar, the world’s most liquid currency and the safe haven of choice when confidence evaporates from financial markets. It has also been hurt by concerns over Britain’s approach to dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, which has seen a more staggered disruption to economic and everyday life than in other countries. Late on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered Britons to stay at home to halt the spread of the virus, imposing curbs on everyday life without precedent in peacetime. Currency analysts said the outlook for sterling remained bearish, partly because of the country’s large current account deficit, although broad-based weakness in the dollar was giving the pound a respite for now. Sterling was last up 1.8% on the day at $1.1763 GBP=D3 - having briefly touched a 35-year low of $1.1413 last week. It was poised for its biggest one-day jump against the greenback since last October. Against the euro, the pound was more than 1% firmer at 91.74 pence EURGBP=D3 - off last week’s lows of 95 pence. “The direction for sterling is still down,” said Morten Lund, senior currency strategist at Nordea. “The big current account deficit has hurt sterling, and so have idiosyncratic reasons such as the increase in coronavirus cases and Brexit uncertainty - although that has taken a back seat for now.” Britain’s economy is shrinking at a record pace, faster than during the 2008-09 financial crisis, as businesses across the services sector shut in face of the coronavirus, a survey showed on Tuesday. The monthly Purchasing Managers’ Index - which was conducted last week before the government late on Friday ordered the closure of all pubs, restaurants and other businesses open to the public - points to the economy shrinking at a quarterly rate of 1.5-2.0%. The data had little immediate impact on the pound, with analysts saying the sharp deterioration in economic activity sparked by the coronavirus outbreak has now been largely factored in by markets. “The British pound is undervalued. We think it has appreciation potential, particularly against the U.S. dollar over our tactical investment horizon, if the UK embarks on a fiscal stimulus package,” UBS Wealth Management said in a note.

5e72ea33c794f1493cada220	Mexican peso slumps to new low against dollar	MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican peso fell by more than 2.6% in early Asian trading, touching a new record low of 24.34 units per dollar, Eikon Refinitiv data showed on Wednesday.

5e81b5ffc496d2354de7302e	U.S dollar looking for direction	Thursday March 7: Five things the markets are talking about Global equities are mostly lower as revised lower economic forecasts add to investor worries about the outlook for global growth. The ‘big’ dollar has climbed for a seventh consecutive session while U.S Treasuries ticked a tad higher. Already this week, the OECD cut global growth estimates again and the U.S trade deficit widened to levels not seen in a decade. Ahead of this morning’s ECB monetary policy meeting, global central banks continue to stay on a “dovish” path. On Monday, RBA governor Lowe signaled it is hard to think “rates will rise,” while yesterday it was the Bank of Canada (BoC) “very bleak” policy statement which put further pressure on the loonie (C$1.3440). Separately, an ECB sourced report ahead of the today’s scheduled meeting (07:45 ET) suggests that growth rate forecasts are likely to come down enough to justify launching a new TLTRO program later this year. Trade remains the dominate theme for markets with investors waiting for details of a possible China-U.S accord, as President Trump is itching to cut a deal with Beijing soon. Elsewhere, sterling (£1.3173) is steady despite European officials being pessimistic about the chances of a breakthrough in Brexit talks this week. In commodities, investors are weighing up a U.S crude-stockpile surge – will it be a threat to OPEC’s bid to avert a glut against a drop-in fuel inventory? On tap: ECB policy makers are expected to leave rates unchanged amid a deteriorating outlook. Draghi will hold a news conference at 08:30 am ET. 1. Stocks have mixed feelings In Japan, the Nikkei hit a one-week low overnight, with chip-related stocks tracking a decline in their U.S. peers and financials retreating as they slash profit outlooks. The Nikkei share average ended down -0.65%, while the broader Topix dropped -0.84%. Down-under, Aussie shares advanced overnight as hopes for an RBA rate cut supported consumer and financial stocks, but gains were capped by a weak mining sector. The S&P/ASX 200 index rose +0.3% at the close of trade. The benchmark gained +0.8% on Wednesday. In S. Korea, the Kospi index fell for a fifth straight session, tracking Wall Street losses the OECD cut global growth forecasts again. The benchmark index fell -0.45%overnight, the index has lost -3.1% in the last five sessions. In China, blue-chips fell overnight after four consecutive sessions of gains while Shanghai shares closed slightly higher, after the finance minister reiterated that China “would not seek to flood a slowing economy with stimulus.” At the close, the Shanghai Composite index was up +0.14%, while the blue-chip CSI300 index ended -1.02% lower. In Hong Kong, stocks fell on Thursday on investor caution over the outlook for global growth. At the close of trade, the Hang Seng index was down -0.89%, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises index fell -1.14%. In Europe, regional bourses trade mostly lower across the board following a mixed session in Asia and lower U.S Index futures ahead of today ECB rate meeting. U.S stocks are set to open in the ‘red’ (-0.23%). Indices: Stoxx600 -0.42% at 373.90, FTSE -0.52% at 7,158.87, DAX -0.53% at 11,526.43, CAC-40 -0.39% at 5,268.38, IBEX-35 +0.09% at 9,305.49, FTSE MIB -0.17% at 20,816.50, SMI -0.52% at 9,348.50 S&P 500 Futures -0.23% 2. Oil edges up on sanctions and OPEC supply cuts, gold unchanged Oil prices are a tad higher ahead of the U.S open amid ongoing OPEC+ led supply cuts and U.S sanctions against exporters Venezuela and Iran. However, gains are being capped by a record U.S crude output and rising commercial fuel inventories. Brent crude futures are at +$66.12 per barrel, up +13c, or +0.2%, from Wednesday’s close. U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures are at +$56.24 per barrel, up +2c. Prices are being supported by efforts led by OPEC+ who have agreed to withhold around +1.2M bpd of oil, a strategy aimed at tightening markets. Also, U.S sanctions against the oil industries of Iran and Venezuela have also had an impact Venezuela’s state-run oil firm PDVSA this week declared a maritime emergency, citing trouble accessing tankers and personnel to export its oil amid the sanctions. However, despite these factors, oil remains in plentiful supply, thanks to surging U.S production, which has resulted in weaker WTI vs. Brent prices. U.S crude oil stockpiles rose much more than expected last week, according to EIA data yesterday, inventories were up by +7.1M barrels to +452.93M barrels. Note: U.S crude oil production remains at a record +12.1M bpd, an increase of more than +2B bpd since early 2018. Gold prices are steady as the U.S dollar trades atop of its two-week high, while lacklustre appetite for riskier assets is offering support to the safe-haven metal ahead of this morning’s ECB meeting. Spot gold is down -0.1% at $1,284.59 per ounce, while U.S gold futures have slipped -0.2% to $1,284.90 an ounce. 3. Sovereign yields fall ahead of ECB Euro sovereign bond yields are lower on reports that the European Central Bank is likely to cut its forecasts enough to warrant kicking off a new round of ultracheap long-term loans for banks. The yield on the 10-year German Bund has fallen to a session low of +0.129%, while the 10-year U.S Treasury yield fell off its session high and was at +2.706%. Analysts have been speculating whether the ECB was likely to take the step to bolster the ailing European economy. So-called TLTROs have been one way the ECB has tried to kickstart growth over the years. Elsewhere, short-dated Italian bond yields have hit their lowest level in seven months ahead of the ECB meet. Italy’s two-year bond yields hit +0.198% in early trade, before settling at +0.23%, still down -4 basis points on the day. 4. Dollar subdued ahead of ECB FX markets are again very quiet in the overnight sessions as investors shift their focus to the ECB rate decision and President Draghi’s press conference (08:30 am). EUR/USD (€1.1313) is steady holding above the psychological €1.13 level ahead of the ECB rate decision. No change in rates are expected, but the market is looking to see if anything is said in regard to the TLTRO operation. Given the recent prolonged economic slowdown in the region many expect the ECB would be eventually forced to provide further stimulus and shift its rate guidance. Note: Market expectations for first potential rate hike was seen in early Q4 2020, compared to the ECB forward guidance of key rates to remain at present level at least through the summer of 2019. In the U.K, Brexit talks appear to be heading nowhere fast, but the GBP/USD (£1.3159) remains confined to a tight range. All the sterling fireworks are expected next week. The Japanese yen is unchanged at ¥111.77 per dollar. 5. Eurozone growth held back by drawdowns Data this morning showed that the eurozone economy picked up in Q4 of 2018, although growth was held back by businesses drawing down on inventories rather than producing new goods. Data from the European Union’s statistics agency showed GDP rose at an annualized rate of +0.9% in the three months through December, up from +0.6% in Q3 and slightly higher than the previous estimate of 0.8%. Note: Growth was supported by a rise in exports, as well as an acceleration in government spending, and a smaller pickup in consumer spending. This article is for general information purposes only.

5e71792a14c04340d7c151f7	Economic Data to Take a Back Seat Once More As Governments Step Up to Combat COVID-19	It was a relatively quiet start to the day on the economic calendar this morning. The Kiwi Dollar and Japanese Yen were in action through the early part of the day, with economic data in focus. While economic data was in focus, the markets also reacted to the overnight moves in the U.S and the U.S administration’s plans to combat the impact of the virus. Economic data was limited to 4th quarter current account figures that had a muted impact on the Kiwi. The current account deficit narrowed from NZ$10.28bn to NZ$9.23bn, year-on-year, with the deficit narrowing from NZ$6.35bn to NZA$2.66bn quarter-on-quarter. The Kiwi Dollar moved from $0.59552 to $0.59598 upon release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Kiwi Dollar was up by 0.02% to $0.5947. The trade balance jumped from a ¥1,313.2bn deficit to a ¥1,109.8bn surplus in February, year-on-year. Economists had forecast a surplus of ¥917.2bn. According to figures released by the Ministry of Finance, The Japanese Yen moved from ¥107.354 to ¥107.505 upon release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Japanese Yen was up by 0.32% to ¥107.36 against the U.S Dollar. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was down by 0.12% to $0.5993. It’s a relatively busy day ahead on the economic calendar. The Eurozone’s finalized February inflation figures and January trade data are due out later this morning. Barring a slide in consumer prices in February, the numbers are unlikely to have a material impact on the EUR. We’ve seen the EU shut its borders and economic conditions deteriorate through March, pointing to a possible Eurozone recession. Any positive numbers will be of little relief, while weak numbers will have an impact when considering the likelihood of more weakness to come. Outside of the numbers, however, expect updates from member states on fiscal policy and the spread of the virus to continue to influence. At the time of writing, the EUR was down by 0.02% at $1.0995. It’s a quiet day ahead on the economic calendar, with no material stats due out of the UK to provide the Pound with direction. A lack of stats will leave the Pound in the hands of the British government that has yet to take more aggressive measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus. At the time of writing, the Pound was up by 0.46% to $1.2111, with oversold conditions providing some early support. It’s a relatively busy day ahead on the U.S economic calendar. February housing starts and building approval figures are due out. With mortgage rates at record lows and confidence in the sector on the rise at the turn of the year, the February numbers are unlikely to reflect sentiment towards the coronavirus. The focus on the day will be the Coronavirus Bill and the Senate vote. Expectations are for the Bill to pass unaltered. Any last mount hiccups could test the markets… We will also expect updates on the spread of the virus to also influence. News hit the wires overnight that all 50 states had coronavirus cases, making it more difficult to contain the virus at the state level. An acceleration in the pace of contraction will weigh on risk appetite. The Dollar Spot Index was down by 0.10% to 99.475 at the time of writing. It’s also a relatively busy day ahead on the economic calendar, with February inflation figures due out later today. We would expect softer inflation figures to weigh on the Loonie, with any pickup in inflationary pressures likely to be considered short-term. Deflationary pressures are expected to build as crude oil prices tumble and the country goes into shutdown mode. Outside of the numbers, crude oil prices and the Canadian government’s plans to combat the virus will remain the key area of focus. As things stand, the Bank of Canada will need to deliver more and soon, though there may be some apprehension after the market’s reaction to the FED move… The Loonie was down by 0.24% at C$1.4236 against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing.

5e81b63dc496d2354de73066	A 200K non-farm payroll (NFP) a non event	Market volatility remains elevated, in part because of confusion over comments by Washington officials re-Sino/U.S trade war this week. The supposed de-escalation of trade tension coming out of the G20 seem to be somewhat misleading and has led to aggressive selling of risk assets and the buying of sovereign bonds. The VIX has jumped back above 25, and the U.S Dollar has come under modest pressure. The U.S 10-year yield has slumped to +2.8%, level not seen since this summer. The 2-year yield has fallen even faster, resulting in benchmark steepening despite a continued inversion at the belly of the curve (2/10’s +13 bps). Trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies – U.S and China – just got trickier with the arrest of the CFO and daughter of the founder of Huawei, in Canada, at the request of the U.S. The U.S has been probing Huawei over possible violation of sanctions against Iran. Chances of a no-deal Brexit are slim but uncertainty looms for the pound because the U.K parliament looks unlikely to approve PM Theresa May’s Brexit deal – voting in the U.K Parliament to begin 14:00 ET on Tuesday, Dec 11. Expect Sterling to continue to trade very nervously. Bank of England (BoE) on Brexit Scenarios: GBP currency could fall -15% in disruptive and -25% in disorderly Brexit. On the commodity front, oil prices continue to remain on the soft side, pressured by a further build in U.S inventories this week. Fearing a glut, OPEC is considering supply cuts at this weeks meeting (Dec 6-7). Russia remains the key, Moscow could contribute a maximum of -150K bpd cut, but the Middle East-dominated OPEC insists Russia cut by -250K-300K bpd. Yesterday’s +179K increase in the ADP measure of private employment in November supports the theory that the official non-farm payrolls figures due this morning will show a similar 190K+ gain. That would represent a slowdown from October’s reading, but should still be enough to convince the Fed to raise interest rates again later this month.

5e5d08bebd5d9d5ac07275d4	Australian Dollar Forecast: AUD/USD, AUD/CAD, AUD/JPY	AUD/USD suffered a critical break beneath support at 0.6678 last week as risk aversion spiked on coronavirus fears. In the days since, the Australian Dollar has continued significantly lower without notable support to buoy price. Despite its extended decline, the pair still lacks a readily available support zone and the driving fundamental concern behind the widespread risk aversion remains uncontrolled. Further still, IG Client Sentiment Data reveals retail traders are overwhelmingly long – expressing confidence the selloff is complete – a revelation we typically view as a sign AUD/USD remains vulnerable. With the fundamental and technical forces leaning lower, it seems possible the pair may venture lower and could eventually test support around 0.6328 which dates to 2009. Similarly, AUD/CAD has experienced a string of sizable declines despite weakness in the Canadian Dollar elsewhere. As a result, the pair trades at its lowest level since June 2010 and may lack noteworthy support until the 0.8655 area – originating from the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the pair’s all-time high and low. Chart created with TradingView Either way, supportive zones are difficult to outline at the current spot price and the damage dealt to the Australian economy from the coronavirus may continue to undermine the Aussie. Should bullishness emerge, however, an early barrier to the recovery will likely reside around 0.89. Interestingly, the sentiment-linked AUD/JPY has not traveled to extremes like AUD/USD and AUD/JPY have. That is not to say the pair has been invulnerable to losses - as it fell significantly – but the pair remains a comfortable distance from decade lows or the similarly historic levels one might expect given price action elsewhere and the risk relationship between the two currencies. Consequently, AUD/JPY may enjoy support nearby as it has recent price action nearby. Residing around 71.88, the horizontal level will look to stall further declines in the days to come as investors try to ascertain the appropriate value for growth-linked assets. In the meantime, it appears as though the Australian Dollar may remain pressured until the viral outbreak is contained and economic activity returns to normal. --Written by Peter Hanks, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com Contact and follow Peter on Twitter @PeterHanksFX	AUD
5e5db39a53ddfe7ee915a326	Euro holds steady as hopes of Fed cut drive traders out of dollars	SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The euro held steady just under its highest in two months against the dollar on Tuesday, on expectations that coronavirus-driven monetary easing in the United States can and will run deeper than any similar action in Europe. Both U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde have hinted at action in recent days. But with the ECB’s benchmark refinancing rate at 0% and the Fed’s funds rate range between 1.5% and 1.75%, the Fed has more room to manoeuvre, leading investors to unwind carry trades accordingly. The euro climbed as high as $1.1185 overnight, its highest since early January while the dollar sank to a six-week low against a basket of currencies. “The dollar is finding good sellers here,” said Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone, in a note. “The markets are seeing vulnerabilities by what is priced into rates (and) senses a Fed who may go hard at 18 March meeting and cut by 50 basis points.” The euro last bought $1.1129 and the dollar steadied on the basket at 97.544, but moves were capped as traders waited to see whether central banks can live up to expectations. The Japanese yen was steady at 108.26 per dollar. The British pound inched higher to $1.2767. Some details may be revealed after G7 finance ministers and central bank governors hold a conference call at 1200 GMT to discuss measures to deal with the widening coronavirus outbreak. The Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) interest rate decision at 0330 GMT will also be closely watched, since it is the first major policy meeting since last week’s dramatic shift in money market pricing. Futures imply that a 25-basis-point cut is all but certain, leaving the Australian dollar vulnerable to a surprise either side. <0#YIB> [AUD/] “If they cut by 50 (basis points), it will fall,” said Westpac FX analyst Imre Speizer. “If they cut by 25 and signalled more to come, that would probably hold the Aussie where it is. If they cut by 25 and signalled no more to come, I think the Aussie would rise.” The Aussie, which hit an 11-year low as markets dived with growing pandemic fears on Friday, was steady in morning trade at $0.6537 - about 1.6% above its trough. The New Zealand dollar also held steady, at $0.6263, since the RBA’s decision may force the hand of New Zealand’s central bank when it meets later in the month. Also on the horizon is the release of euro zone inflation data at 1000 GMT and the Super Tuesday Democratic Party primaries in the United States. The Bank of Canada meets to set its policy rate on Wednesday. Reporting by Tom Westbrook; editing by Jane Wardell	EUR
5e8793f331985d45c99f9c91	Global currency funds notch wins amid coronavirus volatility	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global currency fund managers racked up gains in the first quarter as they benefited from the extreme volatility that the coronavirus pandemic has stoked across financial markets. The BarclayHedge currency traders index was up 6.13% for the first three months of the year and posted a 2.54% gain for March, according to data the firm posted on Friday, showing results for 42% of the funds it tracks. By contrast, the S&P 500 fell 20% in the first quarter in its worst quarterly decline since March 2009, while U.S. crude oil lost 66%. Driving the gains in currency funds has been a surge in the market swings that traders need to make money, as expectations of the worldwide coronavirus-fueled slowdown prompted investors to move out of a broad range of currencies and into the U.S. dollar. The first quarter followed a long period of sleepy trading in currency markets that had frustrated investors and shuttered numerous funds over the years. “March was a period of wild deleveraging, sharp reversals, and extreme moves,” said Richard Benson, co-chief investment officer at Millennium Global Investments in London, with $18 billion in assets under management. Deutsche Bank’s currency volatility index .DBCVIX shot up to 16.36 on March 19, its highest level since at least 2012. It now stands at 10.63. In specific currency pairs, such as dollar/yen, the surge was even more significant, hitting levels last seen in November 2008 in the midst of the global financial crisis. Many of the market’s gyrations have hinged on moves in the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser degree, other haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc. The dollar was the foreign exchange market’s best performer in the first quarter, notching gains of about 2.6% against a basket of major currencies as economic slowdown fears pushed investors to sell assets across the board and pile into cash. The dollar rose 1% last month despite a slew of measures from the Federal Reserve to flood the financial system with greenbacks to address a liquidity crunch caused in part by demand for U.S. currency. The Swiss franc and the yen, two other popular destinations for nervous investors, were up 3% and 1% respectively in the first quarter. Other currencies saw deep losses. Sharp declines in prices for oil, metals, and other raw materials sparked routs in commodity currencies like the Australian dollar and Norwegian krone, which fell 12% and 18% in the first quarter, respectively. Declines in some emerging markets currencies at the end of the March were particularly eye-popping. The Brazilian real fell 23% in the quarter while the Mexican peso slid 20%. “In periods like this, you should be long the U.S. dollar, the yen, and Swiss franc and short everything with low liquidity like the Swedish krona, Norwegian krona, and currencies close to global growth like the Australian and Canadian dollars,” said Momtchil Pojarliev, head of currencies at BNP Asset Management in New York. BNP Paribas Asset Management’s currency program was also up in March, notching 1.5%-2% return on 5% volatility. Long positions in the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen helped BNP’s performance, Pojarliev said. “If anyone has made money in this environment, it is by being risk averse quite quickly,” said Adrian Lee, president and chief investment officer at active currency manager Adrian Lee & Partners, which oversees $12 billion in assets. “To some extent, there was a very gradual response to all the information that was coming out of China. So we went risk averse from the end of February and we still are.” Lee and Millennium’s Benson both said their funds gained in March.

5e81b5b6c496d2354de72fe8	Economic terrorism has equities and bond yields under pressure	Thursday May 30: Five things the markets are talking about Euro equities are trading a tad higher along with U.S futures following a mixed session in Asia overnight as investors continue to assess all the warning signals for global growth amid the latest trade developments. This Thursday, China has ramped up trade rhetoric aimed at Washington. Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanhui indicated that provoking trade disputes is “naked economic terrorism” and that they “opposed a trade war but are not afraid of a trade war.” U.S Treasury yields are steady but do trade atop of their two-year low yields. The much-watched yield gap between U.S 3-month T-Bills and 10’s is sending a warning signal of impending recession now that it slid to a 12-year low yesterday. Note: It’s a Bank holiday (Ascension Day) in Switzerland, Germany and France and market volumes are expected to be lower. In FX, the ‘big’ dollar continues to trade near its five-month high, while the EUR and GBP are steady. Crude prices have had a difficult week as Sino-U.S trade tensions reached the highest levels with China lining up their response to the additional tariffs from the U.S. Oil prices have been dragged down by growing expectations that OPEC+ may fail to agree upon when to meet next, and more importantly if they can agree on continuing productions, while filling the void from sanctioned stricken countries. Today’s U.S revised GDP (08:30 am) should provide further clues on the health of the U.S economy while on Friday, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, core PCE Price Index, is released (08:30 am). On tap: CH, Fr. & DE bank holiday, US preliminary GDP & CNY manufacturing PMI (May 30), CAD GDP & U.S core PCE Price Index (May 31). 1. Stocks mixed results In Japan, the Nikkei share average closed at a 3-1/2-month low overnight, on growing anxiety that the Sino-U.S trade dispute will be prolonged and damaging to the economy. The Nikkei fell -0.29%, its lowest close since mid-February, while the broader Topix also slipped -0.29%. Down-under, Aussie shares closed lower, led by commodity firms and weighed by fresh exchanges in the Sino-U.S. trade war that has hurt global investor appetite. The S&P/ASX 200 index finished -0.7% lower. The benchmark has lost -2% since it scaled a decade high last week. In S. Korea, the Kospi index rebounded from its -1.3% fall in the previous session to close higher on Thursday. The index ended up +0.77% higher. In China, equities remained under pressure as trade war fears heightened after Beijing stepped up its rhetoric against Washington. The blue-chip CSI300 index fell -0.6%, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost -0.3%. In Hong Kong, stocks hit a four-month closing low as trade woes gather sentiment. The Hang Seng index ended down -0.4%, its lowest closing level since January 24, while the China Enterprises Index closed up +0.6%. In Europe, regional bourses have rebounded after yesterday steep losses, following higher U.S futures in a quieter day as certain European nations observe Ascension Day. U.S stocks are set to open small in the ‘black’ (+0.31%). Indices: Stoxx600 +0.35% at 371.82, FTSE +0.24% at 7,202.60, DAX +0.50% at 11,896.48, CAC-40 +0.47% at 5,246.75, IBEX-35 +0.79% at 9,151.85, FTSE MIB +0.37% at 20,074.50, SMI n/c, S&P 500 Futures +0.31% 2. Oil higher on declining U.S stocks, but trade war worries linger Oil prices are small better bid after U.S inventory reports showed a bigger-than-expected decline in crude stocks, although concerns that the Sino-U.S trade war will trigger a global economic downturn is capping gains. Brent crude futures are at +$69.85 per barrel, up +40c, or +0.6%, from yesterday’s close. Brent fell nearly -1% on Wednesday. U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures are up +48c, or +0.8%, at +$59.29 a barrel. API data yesterday showed that U.S. crude inventories fell by -5.3M barrels in the week to May 24 to +474.4M barrels. Expect dealers to take directional clues from today’s official data from the EIA release (10:00 am ET). Ex-U.S, oil prices remain supported by output cuts from OPEC+ as well as falling supplies from Iran. Data this week showed that Iranian May crude exports dropped to less than half of April levels at around +400K bpd. Crude exports remain Iran’s main source of income. Market consensus still believes that OPEC+ cuts will be extended in a meeting to be held either late June or early July, especially since Saudi Arabia wants to prevent oil prices from falling back to levels seen seven-months ago when Brent slumped to +$50 per barrel. Since OPEC+ started withholding supply in January, oil prices have risen by about +30%. For the crude ‘bears,’ concerns that the trade dispute between the U.S and China will trigger a global economic downturn and a slowdown in fuel consumption is capping any significent gains for now. Ahead of the U.S open, gold prices have fallen to one-week low overnight as sovereign bonds have rallied and the ‘big’ dollar trades atop a five-month high, offsetting support for the ‘yellow’ metal from an increasingly bitter Sino-U.S trade dispute. Spot gold is down -0.3% at +$1,275.59 per ounce, while U.S gold futures have edged -0.5% lower to +$1,274.70 an ounce. 3. Sovereign yields edge a tad higher As month end approaches, investors seem content to square up some positions. German Bund yields have climbed for the first time in four days having hit record lows. Despite the Ascension Day holiday in many countries in Europe, the 10-year Bund yield continues to trade rather close to its all-time lows of -0.20% as global growth fears prevail. Currently, the 10-year Bund yield trades at -0.156%, up about +1.5 bps. Elsewhere in Europe, the wide spread level between 10-year Italian BTP’s and German Bund yields continues to reflect the pending clash with the E.U over Italy’s budget deficit. With both Italian deputy prime minister Salvini and the E.U eager to honor their respective mandates, has caused the spread to widen in recent days, albeit still way off levels which repeatedly triggered reconciliation nine-months ago. The 10-year BTP-Bund spread trades at +281 bps. Note: Money Markets are now pricing in roughly two U.S rate cuts by the Fed at the start of next year and the European Central Bank (ECB) is set to turn on its “money taps” again next month as trade worries weigh on the global economy. Stateside, the yield on 10-year Treasuries has increased +2 bps to +2.28%, the largest climb in more than a week, while the yield on two-year notes also rose +2 bps to +2.13%. 4. Dollar trades at five-month highs As we head to the U.S open the WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies, is flat, however, the ‘big’ dollar continues to trade at its five-month highs outright. EUR/USD trades flat at €1.1136, close to the lowest level it has seen so far this year – it reached last week at around €1.1107. Techies believe the ‘single’ unit’s sentiment would have to worsen significantly for the EUR to break below psychological €1.11 handle with any momentum. There is little in the way of economic data releases today that could push EUR/USD either way. Expect risk sentiment to remain the main driver. GBP/USD (£1.2635) is also trading lower, continuing its slow grind towards the psychological £1.26 handle. With nothing new being said, just usual comments about Brexit and no data, £1.26 is expected to create worthy support in the short term. Down-under, AUD (A$0.6931) is keeping to its tight range, but with a mild rebound overnight. Support has come despite a weak set of data which might encourage the RBA to commit to easing rates. Private capital expenditure fell -1.7% in Q1, missing market forecasts of a +0.5% reading. 5. China puts U.S soy purchases on hold as tariff war escalates According to a Bloomberg report this morning, China, the world’s largest soybean buyer, has put purchases of American supplies on hold after the trade war between Washington and Beijing escalated. It’s believed that state-grain buyers “have not received any further orders to continue with the so-called goodwill buying and don’t expect that to happen given the lack of agreement in trade negotiations.” U.S Government data indicates China bought about +13M metric tons of U.S soybeans after the countries agreed to a truce in December, in a move that showed goodwill toward getting the trade dispute resolved. However, in February U.S Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said that China had pledged to buy an additional +10M tons of soy – it’s believed those purchases have now stopped.

5e5d31b7d3c8fc0aa1ab81d4	Has The Panic Market Adjustment Reached A Climax?	"Before the weekend, the S&P 500 closed above its opening level for the first time in seven sessions. It did not close the opening gap, but rallied strongly into the close, encouraged by hints from somber Federal Reserve Chairman Powell that a rate cut is likely. Powell has been criticized for striking wrong chords in press conferences and statements. Still, he did well this time as he indicated greater flexibility than the mantra that has been dragged out repeatedly about how the economy and policy are in a good place. When Powell talked of a midcourse correction, he used language that indicated three rate cuts. His promise to ""act as appropriate"" is understood by many Fed-watchers to signal a rate cut at the March meeting. Like many, we thought that investors had exaggerated the upside in many risk assets. That it is exaggerating the downside is what markets do. It acts like a servo-mechanism. Imagine you are taking a shower and at first the water is too cold. You move the handle to get hotter water, but now it gets too hot, so you push it back. And you go back and forth until you find it, but the markets never find ""it."" While the U.S. market may have seen a selling climax, the technicals suggest the dollar's sell-off against the yen and euro may have more room to run, even if some consolidation is seen first. The greenback rallied strongly against the other major currencies and the Mexican peso and finished outside its Bollinger Bands. It suggests the market has moved too far too fast and cautions against chasing the dollar now. Dollar Index: The Dollar Index fell 1.1% last week to snap a three-week rally. It was the largest weekly decline since last June and finished the week (~98.13) in the middle of this year's range (~96.35-99.90). The next retracement objective (61.8%) is near 97.70, just below the 200-day moving average (~97.85). The MACD and Slow Stochastics show strong downside momentum. The five-day moving average crossed below the 20-day for the first time since January 10. Corrective or consolidative upticks should not extend beyond the 98.70-99.00 band if the downtrend trend is still intact. Euro: The 1.65% advance was the biggest weekly advance in two years. It was the first back-to-back advance this year. The powerful short squeeze, we suspect, was largely a consequence of unwinding of levered positions that used the euro to fund the purchases of other assets, such as stocks or gold. The euro reached nearly $1.1055 ahead of the weekend, just shy of the (61.8%) retracement objective (~$1.1065) of this year's decline. The upper Bollinger Band begins March near $1.1075, and the 200-day moving average is near $1.1100. Although the technical indicators reflect the strong momentum, some near-term consolidation is likely. Support is expected in the $1.0915-$1.0950 band. Japanese Yen: The dollar was probing the JPY112 area on February 21, reaching an eight-month high, and a week later, it tested JPY107.50, a four-month low. It was as if the levered accounts who are short-vol trades and the carry-trades capitulated last week, and the yen was often at the center. When everything was said and done, the dollar fell 3.3% against the yen, its single biggest weekly loss in nearly four years. The dollar closed below its 200-day moving average (~JPY108.40) and its lower Bollinger Band (~JPY108.20). The technical indicators show the strong downside momentum, we suspect there is room to back-and-fill. A move above the JPY108.50 area could signal another big figure advance. British Pound: The selling frenzy took sterling to almost $1.2725 ahead of the weekend, its lowest level since mid-October. Sterling was also under intense downward pressure against the euro. It met the (50%) retracement objective of the rally that took sterling from below $1.20 in early September to almost $1.3515 in mid-December. The MACDs are over-extended, but the Slow Stochastic did not confirm the recent lows, having bottomed around February 11. Initial resistance is seen in the $1.2850-$1.2860 area. A break of the 200-day moving average could signal a move toward $1.2550. Canadian Dollar: As oil was pummeled and risk-aversion jumped, the Canadian dollar was punished. The U.S. dollar's nearly 1.4% gain was the largest since the end of 2018. The market moved to discount a stronger chance of a rate cut on March 4. A week ago, about 5 bp ((~20%) of easing discounted and now nearly 20 bp (~80%). The U.S. dollar reached CAD1.3465 ahead of the weekend, its highest level since the middle of last year. The technical indicators are consistent with additional greenback gains. However, the greenback has finished the previous two sessions above the upper Bollinger Band (~CAD1.3380). Initial support is likely in the CAD1.3335-CAD1.3365 area. Australian Dollar: The Aussie began the week near $0.6625 and plunged to $0.6435 ahead of the weekend. It recovered to about $0.6535 in the North American session before finishing near $0.6515, still below the lower Bollinger Band (~$0.6530). The recovery raises the prospects that a selling climax has been witnessed. The MACD is near a 2-year low while the Slow Stochastic bottomed several weeks ago. A move above $0.6550 would be constructive while resurfacing above $0.6600 would suggest a low of some import may be in place. Mexican Peso: The dollar will take a seven-day, 6% rally against the Mexican peso into the week ahead. It reached almost MXN19.90 ahead of the weekend, which had not been seen since last August, before easing back to about MXN19.64. It began the surge from around MXN18.55. Of course, the momentum indicators are pointing higher, but the dollar finished every session above the upper Bollinger Band. While the Bollinger Band will move toward the price, we expect the levered community to jump back into long peso positions, attracted by the nominal interest rates, which are relatively higher now. Initial support may be seen in the MXN19.40 area. Chinese Yuan: After finishing above CNY7.0 for six consecutive sessions, the dollar finished just below there (~CNY6.9920) ahead of the weekend. Chinese markets are faring relative better than most. The Shanghai Composite fell 5.25% last week, and yuan was one of the few currencies that rose against the U.S. dollar last week. The onshore yuan rose by about 0.5%, and the offshore yuan gained 0.8%. Since China's markets re-opened on February 3, the greenback been in a range roughly between CNY6.95 and CNY7.05. The technical studies on the offshore yuan suggest further strength is likely in the coming sessions, which means there is a risk that the dollar slips through the lower end of the range. Gold: The price of gold peaked on Monday near $1690 and proceeded to sell-off alongside risk assets to hit almost $1563 ahead of the weekend. That means that last week, gold retraced more than half of its gains since dipping below $1460 in early December 2019. The 50% retracement was about $1574, and the next retracement objective (61.8%) is found a little below $1547. The MACD and Slow Stochastic have turned down, which suggests the downside move has more room to run. However, the prospects of lower rates for longer may support the yellow metal. On a 60-day rolling basis, the correlation of the percent change of gold and the S&P 500 is typically inverse. That inversion reached a four-year extreme near -0.67 on February 21 and reached -0.17 ahead of the weekend, its least inversion since last August. Oil: Light sweet crude oil for April delivery has a six-day losing streak in tow. During the streak, it has fallen by about 17% to finish February below $45 a barrel (generic contract) for the first time since July 2017. If the drop is sustained for any period of time, many shale producers will be hit. It is not that they cannot produce oil cheaper, but their ""break-evens"" need to include the fixed cost of their debt. Sustained lower oil prices will also impact investment decisions, and the oil patch was a key driver. The market does look stretched, and the April contract closed below its lower Bollinger Band for the past two sessions. A move above $48 would help stabilize the technical tone. U.S. Rates: The U.S. 10-year yield fell 32 bp last week to 1.15%. It has fallen for seven consecutive sessions and began the streak with a yield near 1.57%. While a decline in inflation expectations may have played a role, the change in expectations of overnight money (Fed policy) may have had a more significant role. Consider that the implied yield of the December 2020 fed funds futures contract has also fallen for the past seven sessions. In that time, the yield has fallen by 45 bp. Powell's statement before the weekend may have eased ideas of an inter-meeting move, but appears to have boosted the risk of a 50 bp move. The implied yield of the March fed funds futures contract closed February at 1.365%. Assuming that the average effective rate remains at 1.58% until the Fed meets on March 18 and the Fed cuts by 25 bp, fair value is about 1.475% yield, and 50 bp cut would suggest fair value is closer to 1.33%. S&P 500: The S&P 500 gapped lower three-times last week, including on Monday, where the gap now appears on the weekly bar charts as well (making it a more important technical signal). None of the gaps were closed, though Powell's statement before the weekend appeared to have sparked a recovery that entered the gap. That gap is the first hurdle and is found between Thursday's (February 27) low (~2977.4) and Friday's (February 28) high (~2957.7). There has been much technical damage inflicted. Beyond the gap is the lower Bollinger Band, which the S&P 500 has closed below for the past four sessions, is found near 3016. The 200-day moving average is near 3047, and the initial retracement (38.2%) objective is near 3060."	USD
5e95a5c301c4277281349ea1	South Africa: SARB surprises again with a 100bps rate cut – TDS	The SARB surprises again with a 100bps repo rate cut to 4.25%, the lowest ever and the first one anticipated by the Reserve Bank with a tweet, per TD Securities. USD/ZAR is trading at 18.2628. “The SARB has cut rates again by 100bps today, lowering the benchmark repo rate to 4.25%, lowest on record. The meeting was unscheduled, and therefore unexpected by definition.” “The SARB now projects growth of -6.1% in 2020 (this compares to -0.2% only three weeks ago), followed by a rebound to 2.2% in 2021 and 2.7% in 2022.” “As we expect a contraction of 7% in 2020, followed by a rebound to 2% next year, we think another 50bps of easing could be in store for the July meeting.” “It is difficult to forecast a USD/ZAR level at this point, but we believe that the rand will remain one of the worst EM FX performers during the course of 2020.”	ZAR
5e87561a2622ab10a1b97e07	This recession will finally end the private-sector ‘debt supercycle,’ says firm that invented the term	Markets aren’t quite back to normal, not by a long shot. But they are getting a little less frantic. The VIX VIX, -8.07% volatility gauge is just over 50, having hit 85 during the worst of the pandemic crisis. Jani Ziedins of the Cracked Market blog expects the S&P 500 SPX, -1.51% to settle into a trading range of 2300 to 2600. It is hardly ideal but, as he writes, “it could take 12 to 24 months to get back to [3,000], but I think most people will be quite content if we stop falling.” So it is worth taking a broader look than just the next few days. BCA Research introduced the concept of the debt supercycle in the 1970s, describing how policy makers wouldn’t let financial imbalances be fully unwound during downturns. The firm declared the debt supercycle dead at the end of 2014, and said it was partly vindicated by household borrowing, relative to income, retreating and the lack of corporate capital spending, though companies did splash out on stock buybacks and mergers and acquisitions. Now the firm is declaring the final nail in the coffin. “The shock of the recession and destruction of wealth will leave a legacy of increased financial caution with households wanting to build precautionary savings and companies striving to repair damaged balance sheets,” writes Martin Barnes, chief economist at BCA, who also says it wouldn’t be surprising to see personal savings rise to the double-digit levels of the 1980s. The flip side of that private-sector retrenching is that there is “the start of an extraordinary surge in public sector deficits and debt from already high levels.” The Federal Reserve, in turn, will remain a massive buyer of Treasury bonds, even “as the economy recovers because it will not want to risk higher yields undermining growth.” As globalization retreats, this will set the stage for inflation to return down the line. “We have long argued that a sustained upturn in inflation would be preceded by a final bout of deflation. The revival of inflation may be gradual but its insidious nature ultimately will make it more dangerous,” he writes. As for the market implications, he says stocks look far more compelling in the medium term than bonds, since yields are so low already and because monetary policy will be supportive. But the short-term outlook is cloudier since no one knows how long the recession will last.

5e8d2ed89a3e0846def60527	US dollar drifts higher as optimism ebbs on coronavirus crisis	"The U.S. dollar edged higher on Wednesday in choppy trading, attracting safe-haven bids, as optimism faded that the coronavirus crisis may be nearing a peak and investor concerns remained over the economic fallout of the pandemic. The greenback's firmer tone came after U.S. equities ended lower on Tuesday. Wall Street shares traded higher in morning trading on Wednesday, but not many analysts were betting they would remain so by the end of the day. ""Optimism has eased and it has to. It's a 50% world. Uncertainty will remain a part of our lives for the next two months,"" said Juan Perez, senior currency trader a Tempus Consulting in Washington. ""There's really a fundamental lack of answer to an important question and that is: are we testing enough ? And the answer is no. So you're not going to get a whole lot of consistency right now,"" he added. The dollar index was flat to slightly higher on the day at 99.993. The dollar has for a month very closely tracked risk appetite as investors and businesses fearing the worst have rushed to the world's reserve currency. Against the yen, the dollar inched higher to 108.79 yen. The euro was slightly lower on the day at $1.0883, weighed down by the failure of European Union finance ministers to agree on further support for their coronavirus-hit economies. The impasse spooked bond markets and sent shorter-dated Italian yields spiking higher. The talks, which are trying to agree a package of measures for governments, companies and individuals, were suspended until Thursday. A feud between Italy and the Netherlands over what conditions should be attached to euro zone credit for governments was blocking progress, sources said. Sterling gained 0.4% against the dollar to $1.2395. The Aussie, which fell in early European trading after ratings agency S&P cut the outlook for its sovereign AAA rating from stable to negative, clawed back losses and turned positive on the day. Still, some analysts were already starting to look at the potentially negative longer term implications for the dollar of the extraordinary stimulus measures launched by Washington and the U.S. Federal Reserve to lessen the economic damage caused by the pandemic. ""If you assume that COVID-19 is tackled by the end of the year ... in 2021 we have fiscal deficits, balance sheet expansion, and the supply of dollars through other measures - it's definitely a very strong background for a weaker dollar,"" said MUFG's Derek Halpenny."

5e5d07dc2e1fe5553d2b6389	The PBoC Holds Loan Prime Rates Steady on a Quiet Day on the Economic Calendar	It was a relatively quiet day on the Asian economic calendar this morning. While key stats are limited to finalized industrial production figures out of Japan later, the PBoC was in action early on. The PBoC held back from providing further support at the start of the year, leaving both the 5-year LPR and the 1-year unchanged at 4.8% and 4.15% respectively. Expectations had been for the 5-year LPR to be cut to 4.7%, with the 1-year to 4.05%. The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.68807 to $0.68793 in response to the cut. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was up by 0.01% to $0.6880. At the time of writing, the Japanese Yen was down by 0.05% to ¥110.20 against the greenback, while the Kiwi Dollar was up by 0.05% to $0.6618. It’s a relatively quiet day ahead on the economic calendar, with wholesale inflation figures for December due out of Germany. Barring a material deviation from forecasts, the numbers are unlikely to have too much influence on the EUR. Late in the day, ECB President Lagarde is scheduled to speak, however, and could provide direction overnight. With the U.S markets closed and volumes on the lighter side, any monetary policy chatter will influence. At the time of writing, the EUR was up by 0.04% to $1.1096. It’s a quiet day ahead on the economic calendar, with no material stats due out of the UK to provide the Pound with direction. With 1-week remaining until Britain leaves the EU and a string of weak stats from last week raising the chances of a BoE rate cut, there’s unlikely to be too much upside for the Pound. There is one silver lining, however. Trump could begin to target the EU on tariffs. This could make a trade relationship between Britain and the EU all the more important for the EU… At the time of writing, the Pound was down by 0.12% to $1.3001. It’s a quiet day on the data front, with the U.S markets closed. The Dollar Spot Index was up by 0.01% to 97.611 at the time of writing. It’s also a quiet day on the economic calendar, with no material stats due out of Canada to provide the Loonie with direction. With the USMCA now awaiting Trump’s signature, upbeat business sentiment could leave the BoC in a holding pattern near-term. GDP numbers will need to start improving, however, for the Loonie to find its way back to sub-C$1.30 levels against the Dollar. The Loonie was down by 0.01% at C$1.3067 against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing.	GBP
5e7ab6237ab4725765b7d473	Dollar drops as US stimulus bill boosts risk-taking	"The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies on Wednesday as a $2 trillion stimulus bill helped boost risk appetite, and reduced demand for the safe haven currency. Stocks surged for a second day as U.S. senators were due to vote on a bipartisan package of legislation to alleviate the devastating economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, hoping it will become law quickly. Investors are also likely reducing dollar exposure ahead of Thursday's jobless claims data, which is expected to show a surge in Americans filing for benefits as businesses close across the country in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. ""Today's developments are a good excuse to pare back on bullish bets on the dollar,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions, in Washington. ""But sentiment is still positive (for the dollar) as uncertainty remains high about the economic damage from the virus."" New York's governor on Wednesday said there were tentative signs that restrictions were slowing the spread of the coronavirus in his state, even as the public health crisis deepened in hard-hit New Orleans and other parts of the United States. Jobless claims on Thursday are expected to rise to around a million, from 281,000 the previous week, according to the median estimate from a Reuters poll of economists. The dollar index fell 0.81% to 101.87. Sterling jumped 1.33% to $1.1913. The euro gained 0.91% versus the greenback to $1.0885. The single currency was also boosted after the German lower house on Wednesday suspended the country's constitutionally enshrined debt brake, approving a massive stimulus package by Chancellor Angela Merkel's government. Germany's economy could contract by as much as 20% this year due to the impact of the coronavirus, an Ifo economist said on Wednesday, as German business morale tumbled to its lowest level since the global financial crisis in 2009. Investors are also continuing to absorb the Federal Reserve's unprecedented announcement on Monday that it would launch unlimited quantitative easing, and how that will impact the greenback. ""QE was first introduced back in 2008, the dollar initially weakened but then recovered to even stronger levels.

The Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has released the schedule of large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement (repo) operations for the monthly period from April 14, 2020 through May 13, 2020. The Desk intends to reduce the frequency of some repo operations during this monthly period in light of more stable repo market conditions. Beginning on Monday, May 4, 2020, the Desk intends to return to regularly conducting one overnight repo operation per day in the morning, and to remove the afternoon overnight repo operation. In addition, the frequency of three-month repo operations will be reduced to once every two weeks from once a week. The Desk will continue to conduct one-month repo operations once per week. The Desk will continue to adjust repo operations as appropriate to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample and to support the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets, consistent with the FOMC directive to the Desk. Detailed information on the schedule and parameters of term and overnight repo operations are provided on the Repurchase Agreement Operational Details page. The Fed's liquidity injections had helped to keep the cost of borrowing down in repo funding markets, stabilising the US dollar with recent take-up of the Fed's operations falling sharply.	USD
5e792be7daf8257bdfa046d8	USD/MXN Forecast: US Dollar to Mexican Peso Extends Parabolic Climb	The US Dollar has recorded a staggering 30% surge against the Mexican Peso since USD/MXN bottomed out mid-February around the 18.500 price. Spot USD/MXN now trades well above the 25.000 handle as the Mexican Peso, a top emerging market currency, crumbles as the US Dollar, a popular safe-haven currency, skyrockets. USD/MXN has staged a confounding rebound over the last few weeks since the most liquid and heavily traded EM FX pair notched a 16-month low in early February. In fact, USD/MXN is currently trading at its highest reading on record. The monumental rise in USD/MXN might seem a bit overextended, however, considering spot prices are pressing technical resistance presented by the 3-standard deviation Bollinger Band upper barrier. Also, USD/MXN might gravitate back lower around technical confluence underscored by the 161.8% Fibonacci extension of the January 2017 to July 2017 bearish leg. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView That said, fundamental drivers like the crude oil price war and rise in recession risk could continue fueling the parabolic climb in USD/MXN. The Mexican Peso, which is closely tied to the price of oil, has crumbled as the collapse in crude oil pressures Pemex – Mexico’s state-owned oil company. At the same time, extremely high readings of FX volatility have largely bolstered the US Dollar as coronavirus concerns plague market sentiment. As such, USD/MXN has potential to keep churning higher within its upward-sloping bullish channel extended through the ongoing series of higher highs and higher lows. Also, the 9-period and 34-period exponential moving averages on the 4-hour USD/MXN price chart reveal the short-term and medium-term uptrend, which could continue supporting the US Dollar relative to the Mexican Peso. -- Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight	MXN

Resistance comes in at the 1.0950 where a break will turn risk towards the 1.1000 level. A breach above here will target the 1.1050 level. Further up, resistance stands at the 1.1100. Conversely, on the downside, support comes in at 1.0900 level with a violation of there opening the door for further gain towards the 1.0850 level. Further down, resistance lies at the 1.0800 level. A breakthrough that level will clear the way for a move towards the 1.0750 level. All in all, EUR/USD looks for more upside pressure on correction.	USD
5e7bdbbdd7330b6aea191270	Nikkei 225 Forecast for the Week Ahead	Stocks have enjoyed a significant recovery this week as governments look to inject their respective economies with stimulus to assist workers and businesses alike. As a result, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 have pressed higher, so too has the DAX 30. Not to be outdone, the Nikkei 225 has reclaimed several technical levels of note as it climbs alongside its sister indices. Consequently, bulls may look to continue the rebound rally but resistance looms overhead. To that end, an early barrier to a continuation higher may reside around the Fibonacci level at 20,365 which has given rise to price indecision in the past. While the zone is unlikely to make or break a stock rally on its own, its influence over price should not be ignored as it may present an attractive opportunity to reduce or increase exposure – depending on your directional bias. If bulls can retake the level confidently, subsequent resistance may come into play around the 200-day simple moving average but risks to the rally loom large, namely initial jobless claims from the United States due Thursday. As it stands, many analysts are expecting a meteoric rise in the number of claims, and understandably so. USD/JPY Targets February High Alongside Staggering Dow Jones Rally In the event the figure overshoots the already elevated expectations, risk appetite may vanish and send stocks plummeting once again. Should the Nikkei fall prey to such price action, early areas to watch exist at the 19,040, 18,220 and 16,105 levels – each of which coincides with a prior swing low. Together, they will look to buoy price and ward off a deeper retracement beneath the low tagged last week at 15,337. Since forecasting directional moves remains exceedingly difficult, traders can look to utilize the various technical levels as areas to reduce or increase exposure in accordance with their underlying bias. That being said, I am hesitant to suggest stocks will continue this parabolic recovery, a topic I discuss at length in my weekly stock market webinar.

5e7db7652e12316b18da625e	FTSE Snaps 3 Day Winning Streak	The FTSE has opened on the back-foot snapping three straight sessions of gains. Despite the slip lower this morning the UK index is still on track for gains in the region of 10% across the week, its first winning week since early February. The big question is whether this is a false floor or whether it is the start of a more meaningful advance? The awful data is only just starting to show through. Chinese industrial profits slumped by the most on record. Italian and French consumer confidence is expected to plunge. US consumer confidence in focus US consumer confidence figures will guide trader’s sentiment this afternoon. After yesterday’s record breakingly dreadful initial jobless claims, consumer confidence in the US has to be on its knees. Whilst yesterday we saw dire data boost expectations of more US stimulus and lift markets higher, today we might not see the same reaction. There is a good chance that traders are still too nervous to hold positions over the weekend. This will be at telling signal as to how ready traders are to continue the push higher. The number of cases in the US, the world’s largest economy have surpassed the number in China or Italy. Numbers over the weekend could escalate sharply. House builders under pressure as housing market stalls Here on the FTSE UK house builders could struggle as the UK housing market is being brought to a near standstill by coronavirus. Even those that have exchanged contracts are being advised not o complete, with mortgage lenders extending mortgage offers for three months to help the rebound after the social distancing measures are eased. Levels to watch The FTSE has dropped 3% on the open after failing to push through resistance at 100 sma on 4-hour chart. Immediate support can be seen 5448 (yesterday’s low) prior to 5254 (50 sma) and 4762 (low 23rd March). On the flip side, strong resistance is at 5787 (today’s high & 100 sma) prior to 6230 (high 10th March).	GBP
5e5d07555040145532db642c	GBP/USD whipsaw continues on post-Brexit EU-UK clash	Every party has its hangover – and Brexit is no exception. Fresh tensions between London and Brussels explain part of GBP/USD’s downfall – near 300 pips since Friday and hitting the lowest levels since mid-December. Here are three reasons for the crash: After the UK officially left the EU on January 31, both sides laid down their visions for post-Brexit relations after the transition period expires at year-end, The differences are stark. Michel Barnier, the EU’s Chief Negotiator, said that to have easy market access, the UK would have to align itself with EU rules, including adhering to the European Court of Justice. On the other hand, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson rejects taking any rules from the bloc and maintained a combative tone. Both sides are also at loggerheads over fisheries and other topics. If they fail to strike an agreement, Britain will deal with the EU on World Trade Organization terms (WTO) which would be a shock to the economy. The near simultaneous speeches from both sides of the Channel sparked cable’s sell-off. The coronavirus outbreak continues raging, claiming the lives of over 400 people and infecting over 20,000. A second death outside China was reported in Hong Kong while Belgium reported its first infection. Economic activity in Asia and elsewhere is under pressure. While stocks are moving from falls to recoveries, the greenback is one of the currencies of choice. Contrary to last week’s dollar dumping – correlated with sliding US bond yields – the world’s reserve currency is enjoying higher demand now. Further headlines are set to impact markets. The ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index beat expectations by rising to 50.9 – a jump of over three points and reflecting a return to growth. It seems that the US consumer was able to push forward despite industry dragging the economy down 0 and now manufacturing is on its feet again. The figure also serves as a hint toward Friday’s Non-Farm Payrolls. The US publishes Factory Orders for December later on Tuesday, and a bounce is on the cards there as well. Overall, GBP/USD has many reasons to fall these seem to outweigh initial signs of recovery in the British economy. Markit’s Manufacturing PMI for December was upgraded to 50 – exactly the threshold that separates expansion from contraction. On its way down, pound/dollar fell below the 50, 100, and 200 Simple Moving Averages on the four-hour chart. Moreover, it dropped below the uptrend support line that had accompanied it since mid-January and momentum turned negative. However, the Relative Strength Index is close to 30 – near oversold conditions. This development implies that an upside correction may be coming soon. A correction could be temporary. GBP/USD continues battling 1.2955, the low point in January. Further down, 1.29 is a round level and also worked as support in mid-December. It is followed by 1.2875, 1.2820, and 1.2775. Looking up, resistance awaits at 1.2975, which was a cushion in late January. Next, 1.3010 is a veteran resistance line, and it is followed by 1.3035, which held GBP/US down in late January. 1.3075, 1.3110, and 1.3175 are next.	GBP
5e5f5256307b5d31d5f5e201	Gold Prices Eye BOC After Fed Rate Cut Amid Coronavirus Fears	Gold prices were steady through the Asia Pacific Wednesday session, retaining gains made in US hours when the Federal Reserve slashed borrowing costs in an attempt to mitigate the economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak. The Fed’s surprise half-percentage point reduction came on the heels of a more widely expected cut to Australian interest rates this week. The prospect of lower global interest rates and, therefore, bond yields increases the attraction of holding gold as its lack of yield becomes less of a problem. Risk-free financial assets such as US Treasuries are among the metal’s closest rival’s in the haven asset sphere and, with ten-year yields there now down to record lows, the environment looks very supportive of gold. The Bank of Canada will give its March monetary policy decision later in the global day. It may well join in the growing round of monetary easing even though surveys of economists taken before this week’s Fed action didn’t expect a rate cut. Various Purchasing Managers Indexes are also due from around the Eurozone and US. The Chinese versions of these timely snapshots have underlined the coronavirus’ drag on that economy. Gold may get more support if a growing impact is evident elsewhere. Crude oil prices were higher as energy markets anticipate significant cuts in production will be announced later this week. A panel from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, the so-called ‘OPEC Plus’ group, has recommended taking an additional million barrels per day out of the market. This may mean that Saudi Arabia and Russia are close to settling well-publicized differences stemming from initial Russian reluctance to move. US time Wednesday will bring the release of official inventory data but with markets focused on both the coronavirus and this week’s OPEC Plus meeting in Vienna it may struggle to move prices far. Prices have once again soared above the broad trading band at which gold has had solid support since early January. They are very close to a resistance area which guards the way back up to 2020’s eight-year highs. It remains to be seen whether an interest rate cut from the Bank of Canada can provide the impetus needed to top those highs, but such a move should see gold back into that trading band, at least. Hope of those production cuts have seen arguably quite modest gains for US crude oil prices so far. The downtrend channel which has dominated trade since January remains very much in command. The bounce seen in the last four days was initiated at the lows of 2019 but it’s notable that, even with significant supply reductions expected, the price is still yet to top the psychologically important $50/barrel point. It may very well manage to rise above this area should cuts be announced this week, with channel-top resistance at $51.12 also likely to come into play in that case. --- Written by David Cottle, DailyFX Research Follow David on Twitter@DavidCottleFX or use the Comments section below to get in touch!

5e750ac70cc92c7823b68f3b	S&P Tests Support, EUR/USD Sell-Off Slows as USD Tempers Gains	The panic continues as matters have moved-up to the next level in the United States with a near-full shutdown of New York City in response to the continued growth of the novel coronavirus. Going by the expectation for exponential growth, it’s expected that the virus will continue to infect the population creating considerable strain on the medical system. And while none of this is necessarily ‘new’ news nor is it unexpected, these unprecedented actions bring with them a number of questions around a global economy that was already being propped-up by almost a decade’s worth of accommodation. Both monetary and fiscal policy in the United States have been aimed squarely at off-setting at least some impact from the growing crisis. But, one of the few was to slow the spread or ‘flatten the curve’ is social distancing – which means an almost certain continued disruption as people are forced to self-isolate. The S&P 500 is already off by 30% in a little over a month. The one bright spot here is the fact that through this week, despite a general sense of bearish behavior continuing in global markets, the S&P has clung to some element of support. The bulk of this week’s losses on the S&P 500 took place on Monday as the prior Friday rally was faded-out and then some. Sellers were a bit more tepid on Tuesday through Thursday, with the area between 2354-2400 helping to slow the sell-off, at least temporarily. Chart prepared by James Stanley; SPX500 on Tradingview The big question and perhaps something that’s problematic is the fact that there hasn’t been a greater market response to these historic moves by global Central Banks and, in some ways, it’s starting to feel as if each new measure taken is only eliciting more fear from the risk trade. Case-in-point, yesterday brought another rate cut out of the Bank of England and the reaction was a quick bearish move in the S&P 500; pretty much the opposite of what one might expect. And even this Monday’s bearish move, which really started on Sunday night when futures began to trade. This came shortly on the heels of another FOMC announcement that saw the bank yank rates down to the lower-bound while also re-firing QE to the tune of $700 Billion. Again – this is something that investors would normally look to bring strength back into stocks as the representative Central Bank is getting more accommodative. But not only did that not happen – but S&P futures quickly went limit-down after the open and after the announcement as investors appear to be getting more and more frightened. The big question for next week is whether the S&P 500 has finally found some element of support that might hold the lows. This comes in around the 38.2% retracement of the post-Financial Collapse move, spanning from the 2009 low up to the 2020 high. In five short weeks, more than a third of that bullish trend has been erased to cap a remarkable move in a key market. Chart prepared by James Stanley; SPX500 on Tradingview It was a rough week for the Euro as the currency dropped to a fresh two-year-low against the US Dollar. A two-year-low doesn’t really tell the story, however, as it’s the recent rate of change that’s most impressive, and this is likely coming from a dual-impact type of scenario. As the world has grown more and more cautious around the potential economic impact of a prolonged shutdown, investors have driven into the relatively safe harbors of the US Dollar, creating an outsized move in the USD. But, similarly, a growing sense of fear around the Euro-Zone has shown as coronavirus-caused shutdowns are adding pressure on a European economy that was already struggling before all of this began. Perhaps exacerbating matters is the fact that the ECB has been ‘pedal to the floor’ on the stimulus front for much of the prior five years so, when a big risk or a temporary shutdown did show – chaos ensued. In EUR/USD, the pair dropped down below the 1.0725 area that had previously marked the low point of the gap. Over the past day EUR/USD has appeared to put in a support hold around the 1.0650 area; below current price action brings additional support potential around the 1.0593 area, after which the 1.0500 psychological level lurks. Below that is the 17-year low at 1.0340; and the next obvious level beyond that price for follow-through support is the parity figure that hasn’t been in-play since 2002. Chart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/USD on Tradingview On that topic of safe-havens, there’s been a remarkable move in the US Dollar over the past few weeks, going along with a similarly remarkable move in US Treasuries. I had discussed this a couple of days ago and the move in the US Dollar continued-higher in the immediate aftermath. The US Dollar has traded up to the 103.00 level on DXY, its strongest value in three years; and sitting just ahead is a big zone of resistance that turned the currency around in early 2017 trade. Beyond that – we’re looking at fresh 17-year-highs and this is likely something that will continue to garner attention as the world is wrestling with this new, unexpected risk of the novel coronavirus – along with the potential collateral damage to fledgling economies in Europe.

5e781177a7e6571e56bc6a00	US Dollar, S&P 500 Eyeing Bipartisan US Fiscal Stimulus Package	The US Dollar and equity markets are being tormented by uncertainty surrounding the US fiscal response to the coronavirus as Republican and Democratic lawmakers wrestle to push their own plan forward. Early into Asia’s Monday trading session, news outlets announced that Democrats had blocked the Republican-held Senate’s fiscal plan after talks broke down. It was estimated to inject $1.6 trillion into the economy. US Dollar Index, S&P 500 Futures – Daily Chart US Dollar index chart created using TradingView However, following the fallout, US President Donald Trump said he will work with Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to get a stimulus package through. He added that the world’s largest economy may need another cash injection, though hopefully this will not be required. The Speaker said the House will now push ahead with its own bill, which will test the validity of the President’s pledge to work across the aisle. “We’ll be introducing our own bill and hopefully it will be compatible” Ms. Pelosi said on Sunday, with expectations that the House Appropriations Committee could have the legislative text drafted as soon as Monday. However, the fluidity of the situation and anticipation of compromise make forecasting for what the plan could be exceptionally difficult in an already uncertain environment. The original Senate plan – known as the CARES Act – includedsending $1,200 checks to every qualifying American and delaying tax filings from April 15 to July 15. It also includes billions of dollars’ worth of emergency relief funds to distressed businesses. In addition, approximately $58 billion in loans and loan guarantees to distressed airline companies that face bankruptcy would be made available. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard warned that the unemployment rate in the US could skyrocket to 30 percent in the second quarter, with expectations of a 50% dip in GDP. He said, “everything is on the table” and struck a similar note to Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who said in a CBS interview that monetary authorities could do more if necessary. Here is a summary of what the Fed did last week. In regard to the prior liquidity injection, Mr. Bullard said “we can go much higher if necessary” and suggested the central bank could look into giving more help to distressed short-term corporate debt markets. The latter has become a particular concern, especially in the leveraged loan space that policymakers fear could exacerbate a downturn. Mr. Bullard – like many central bank officials all over the world – stressed that monetary policy alone cannot completely cushion the economic blow dealt by Covid-19. He also emphasized the need for a powerful fiscal response to help the US economy recover from the virus-induced disruption. However, as we have already seen, reaching a consensus may be difficult. Coronavirus Update: Total Confirmed Cases Extend Beyond 330,000 Source: Johns Hopkins This may have to do with the upcoming US Presidential election. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have a strong interest in pushing a stimulatory policy forward that they can take credit for ahead of when ballots are cast in November. Consequently, this tug-of-war could result in delays and undermine what are now flickers of optimism about a coordinated effort that just might cushion the impact of an incoming recession. --- Written by Dimitri Zabelin, Jr Currency Analyst for DailyFX.com To contact Dimitri, use the comments section below or @ZabelinDimitrion Twitter	USD
5e81db4c58f4bd68cedea468	Will EUR/GBP Continue Sliding?	EUR/GBP has been trading in a consolidative manner since Friday, between the 0.8905 and 0.8990 levels. Overall, the pair has been in a sliding mode below a downside resistance line since March 19th, and although it stands above an upside line drawn from the low of February 18th, we believe there is ample room for more declines. A break below Friday’s low of 0.8905 could bring the 0.8844 barrier into play, which almost coincides with the 200-EMA on the 4-hour chart. If that level is broken as well, then we could see the bears diving towards the 0.8740 area, which acted as a resistance between March 2nd and 4th. Another slide, below 0.8740, may extend the slide towards the low of March 5th, at around 0.8620, or the aforementioned upside line taken from the low of February 18th. Looking at our short-term oscillators, we see that the RSI rebounded from near its 30 line, but turned down again, while the MACD, although flat, lies below both its zero and trigger lines. Both indicators detect downside speed and support the notion for some further declines in this exchange rate. On the upside, we would like to see a break above 0.9275 before we start examining whether the bulls have gained the upper hand. The rate would already be above the downside line taken from the high of March 19th, while the break above 0.9275 would confirm a forthcoming higher high on the 4-hour chart. The bulls may sail north towards the high of March 23rd, at around 0.9385, the break of which may allow them to put the psychological 0.9500 hurdle on their radars. That barrier was last tested on March 19th.	GBP
5e5d07b4203be655205b7ab1	Dollar rebounds from 2-week lows; euro volatility rises	The dollar rebounded on Wednesday from a two-week low hit in the previous session as investors scaled back expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would signal more policy easing in response to a deadly virus spreading outside China. However, broader market sentiment remained cautious, with implied volatility gauges on euro/dollar rising to 4-1/2 month highs while commodity currencies like the Australian and the kiwi dollar came under fresh selling pressure. “The broader theme of risk aversion is still impacting FX markets, though markets are starting to reprice some of their excessive policy easing expectations,” said Manuel Oliveri, a currency strategist at Credit Agricole In London. That was evident in expected price swings for the euro currency, with one-month maturities rising to an early October high of 5.7% after hitting a six-year low of 2.3% last week. But gyrations in derivatives had little impact on broader cash markets, with the single currency struggling to push above the $1.09 level on Wednesday. It was trading at $1.08760. Commodity currencies came under some selling pressure, with the Aussie and the Kiwi dollar shedding half a percent each against a broadly sturdy greenback. As the coronavirus outbreak started to spread quickly to the Middle East and Europe, some investors no longer saw the U.S. economy as immune and started to bet the Federal Reserve would have to cut interest rates to support growth. But Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Tuesday that while the central bank is monitoring the impact of the epidemic on the U.S. economy, it is still too soon to gauge if it would require a change in monetary policy. While money markets have also increased expectations of more cuts from the Fed, with interest rate futures now pricing in about 60 bps of cuts by the end of the year compared to 40 bps a month earlier, investors were slightly more cautious. The bid-to-cover ratio, an indicator of demand, of a U.S. 2-year Treasury note auction was less than a similar sale, indicating hedge funds were not aggressively buying shorter-dated debt, expecting a more cautious Fed. “The significant dovish tilt being priced in by markets from the FOMC may not materialise and that might cause the next leg of the dollar rally,” said Peter Chatwell, head of multi-asset strategy at Mizuho Bank. Against a basket of its rivals, the dollar edged 0.1% higher to 99.04, recovering from two-week low of 98.876 hit in the previous session.	USD
5e5e575bbc44336f4edf07e4	S&P 500 Q4 Earnings Recap + 6 Stocks with Low China Exposure to Watch	In times of market turmoil, it’s tempting for traders to get caught up in the day-to-day headlines and take their eye off the proverbial ball. Last week’s breathtaking -12% swoon in US indices provides a perfect case study: while we don’t want to downplay the massive human and economic cost of coronavirus, the related tumble in US equities has certainly provided bullish traders an opportunity to scoop up firms that, at least according to the most recent earnings reports, continue to increase profits while they’re “on sale.” With 95% of the companies in the S&P 500 reporting results, the “blended” earnings growth rate (using companies that have reported and estimates for the 5% of companies that haven’t yet reported) is +0.9%, according to the earnings mavens at FactSet. This marks the first quarter of positive year-over-year earnings growth since Q4 2018 (note that the effects of the Trump Administration’s corporate tax cuts, which went into effect at the start of 2018, made annualized comparisons tough throughout last year). More to the point, 71% of S&P 500 companies beat consensus analyst earnings estimates, roughly in-line with the 1- and 5-year averages, while 65% of firms beat revenue forecasts, well above the 1- and 5-year averages. Generally speaking, top-line revenues are more difficult to manipulate than earnings, so the stronger-than-expected revenue figures paint a bullish fundamental picture for US stocks heading into 2020. As the chart below shows, sales in the Communication Services and Health Care sectors were particularly strong relative to expectations, while the Utility sector reported generally disappointing revenues: Source: FactSet Of course, the stock market is a forward-looking animal, so traders will be keen to see if US companies can maintain the positive momentum amidst the economic disruptions stemming from the spread of coronavirus in Q1. As of the start of the week, 68 companies in the S&P 500 had issued negative earnings guidance for the first quarter, while just 32 companies issued positive guidance. Likewise, analysts have slashed Q1 earnings estimates by -3.3%, which is only slightly higher than the -2.3% average decline in quarterly EPS forecasts that we’ve seen over the last ten years. In the coming weeks, we fully expect more companies will be forced to acknowledge negative impacts from COVID-19, which will likely provide a headwind for US stocks. Drilling down a bit, the Technology sector has the highest revenue exposure to China, COVID-19’s epicenter, at 13.4% vs. 4.8% for the broader S&P 500 and may therefore be particularly vulnerable to downgrades. That said, among the so-called FAANG stocks, Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) have essentially zero direct exposure to China and are therefore in a better position to weather the proverbial storm. Both of these companies would also benefit from users staying inside in an effort to limit their exposure to the disease. In contrast, the Utility and Real Estate sectors have among the least exposure to Greater China, so those may be other areas for US-focused value hunters to monitor. The biggest names in these sectors include NextEra Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK), American Tower (AMT) and Prologis (PLD). These stocks, along with the Utility and Real Estate sectors more broadly, also offer solid dividend yields and may therefore benefit from further risk aversion in the broader markets.

5e84519a5617c551e3aa205c	Recession angst whacks pound as dollar surges	LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling slipped on Wednesday, losing ground to a surging dollar amid a wider selloff in global stock markets as data showed factory activity in Asia contracting sharply due to the coronavirus pandemic. Manufacturing gauges tumbled in Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, with Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) surveys underscoring the widening damage wrought by the pandemic that has infected more than 700,000 people, upended supply chains and led to city lockdowns worldwide. IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ index for Britain’s manufacturing sector is due at 0830 GMT, and economists polled by Reuters forecast a fall to 47.0 in March from 51.7 in February.

OPEC+ proposed a 10 mb/d in its last meeting on Thursday, but Mexico disagreed with the 400,000 mb/d it was asked to cut. Under the latest deal, the country is only required to cut 100,000 mb/d.

5e95792da970ab0cb6a1a4a5	UK total deaths in week ending 3 April was 6,082 above average, implying higher coronavirus mortalities	The UK Office for National Statistics has said that the total number of UK deaths in the week ending on April 3 is 6,082 above average. It has reported that only one in five of all deaths has been attributed to COVID-19. Sir David Behan, a former chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, said that he thought the actual number of deaths due to coronavirus is higher than officially reported. The UK is not the only country coping with counting issues. On the one hand, some have died due to the novel virus but also as a result of other sicknesses. On the other hand, not every person dying from COVID-19 has been tested, especially those that did not reach a hospital. Estimates in Spain's Madrid region estimate around 3,000 more deaths than usual. Here is one of the slides published by the ONS:	GBP
5e95c1d710dc0f05bff4d20e	S&P 500: From fear to opportunity	The reversal in the normal VIX and S&P 500 relationship from March 20 to April 6 portrayed the psychological shift in the equity market from fear to opportunity, an insight that was an excellent and timely indicator of the equity reversal, FXStreet’s Joseph Trevisani reports. “On nine of the 11 sessions from March 20 to April 6 the VIX and the S&P, higher or lower, moved in tandem.” “The selling panic became grossly overextended. In technical terms, the market was oversold but psychologically enough traders must have realized that further selling was an opportunity, not a threat.” “Further selling was a positive development and positives bring down the volatility index.” “For the professionals and money managers, a 31% decline in four weeks is a rare, a very, very rare opportunity to buy vastly undervalued stocks and set up a year of stellar performance. They needed to buy into the market in the fastest, most efficient and profitable way.” “Every purchase was a calculated risk and every rise in the market made those risks more imperative and harder to execute.”	EQUITY
5e5d091973d82f5acc8afd02	Week Ahead: Now that US-China Trade Deal is Signed, What’s Next?	Aside from the ceremonial signing of “Phase One” of the US-China Trade Deal, this past week was seemingly uneventful. The US Senate passed the United State- Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and it is currently waiting President Trump’s signature. Things between the US and Iran in the Middle East have calmed down, and stocks have continued their climb to all time highs on the back of better bank earnings. The World Economic Forum’s annual meeting will be held next week in Davos, beginning on Wednesday. Many world leaders and large companies attend this event, including large oil companies, and it may be good for some potentially market moving soundbites. With many of the political and geo-political events on the sidelines (for now), the markets next week are likely to begin focusing once again on central banks, macro-economic data and earnings. There are three Central Bank meetings next week, which include the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, and the European Central Bank. Earnings season kicks into high gear next week, with such notables reporting as HAL, NFLX, TXN, JNJ, and AXP. In addition, macro-economic data highlights for next week are as follows: Monday Martin Luther King Jr. Day – US Markets closed ECB President Lagarde Speech Tuesday BOJ Interest Rate Decision and Quarterly Outlook Report UK Employment data (DEC) Claimant Count expecting +26,000 vs +28,800 last German and EU ZEW Economic Sentiment Index (JAN). Expectations are for 15 and 6, respectively. Wednesday Canada Inflation Rate (YoY) (DEC) Expectations are for 2.2% vs 2.2% last (MoM) expectation is for 0% vs -0.1% last BOC Interest Rate Decision and Monetary Policy Report (MoM) expectation is for 0% vs -0.1% last BOC Interest Rate Decision and Monetary Policy Report Thursday Australian Consumer Inflation Expectations (JAN) Expecting 3.7% vs 4% last Australian Employment Change (DEC) Expecting +16,000 vs +39,900 last ECB Interest Rate Decision, Press Conference, and Strategic Review Crude Oil Inventories Friday BOJ Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes Worldwide Flash PMIs – In particular, for the US this will be the first piece of manufacturing data since the US-China trade deal was agreed. Markets participants will look closed to watch for an uptick in US PMIs. ECB President Lagarde Speech Canadian Retail Sales (MoM) (NOV) Expecting 0.4% vs -1.2% last Chart to Watch: USD/JPY Source: Tradingview, FOREX.COM As stocks continue to put in new all-time highs, USD/JPY is moving right along with them. During the first week of the year, price put in a bullish engulfing candle after a false breakout out of the rising wedge. Last week, USD/JPY squeezed above strong horizontal resistance and the 200-week moving average near 109.70. The pair is currently approaching a long term downward sloping trending dating back to mid-2015. If price breaks above the trendline, it will look to fill the gap from the first week of May 2019 near 110.90/111.00.	USD
5e94f73074052b6b8ec3bc6f	NZD/USD: Pierces 0.6100 ahead of China trade numbers	While extending its pullback from intraday lows around 0.6070, NZD/USD remains on the front foot near 0.6100 during Tuesday’s Asian session. The kiwi pair registers seven-day winning streak while trading close the highest levels last seen on March 16. The reason for the run-up could be traced from the broad US dollar weakness amid a widespread outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the US. Upbeat comments from US President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, not to forget the attempt to placate traders during the Task Force Briefings, fail to supersede fears of the pandemic. The deadly disease has so far infected more than 580,000 and claimed the lives of above 20,000 people in the world’s largest economy. With this, the US also becomes the global hotspot for the pandemic. On the other hand, New Zealand’s (NZ) handling of the virus outbreak has so far gained praise whereas the latest NZ Visitor Arrivals for February, down 10.8% YoY versus +2.9% prior, signals further hardships for the economy. Even so, the kiwi remains mostly strong due to its self-reliance in food as well as upbeat fundamentals. Market’s trade sentiment seems to have recovered in Asia as the US stock futures flash mild gains of below 0.50% while parting ways from the previous day’s of downbeat Wall Street performance. However, the earnings season is on the door and market giants are likely to register murky numbers due to the lockdowns in many countries, which in turn could exert additional downside pressure on the US dollar. On an immediate basis, China’s March month trade balance could offer fresh direction to the pair. Forecasts suggest a recovery in the headlines Trade Balance figures from $-7.09B to $18B. Further, the YoY Exports likely to bounce from -17.2% to -15% but Imports may drop to -8% from -4.0% previous readouts. Even if China data signals further upside of the pair, a likely disappointment due to the broad efforts to tame the virus can’t be ruled out. Unless declining below the monthly support line, currently at 0.6040, NZD/USD can keep rising towards a 50-day SMA level of 0.6155.	NZD
5e81b63dc496d2354de7306f	Sterling falls on Brexit vote worries, Trump weighs in	Tuesday November 27: Five things the markets are talking about U.S stock futures are lower; along with European shares while gains in Asian equities were capped overnight after President Trump’s comments on further Chinese tariff hikes casted doubt on an ending to a trade war between the worlds two largest economies. U.S Treasuries and the ‘big’ dollar are holding steady ahead of Thursday’s FOMC minutes for clues to future interest rate policy. Elsewhere, euro-zone bonds have rallied this morning; while the ‘single’ unit remains under pressure as concerns persist that the eurozone economy is slowing. The pound is lower as the market considers the prospects for parliamentary approval of the Brexit deal. Elsewhere, emerging market currencies are weaker overnight and their equities traded little changed. Bitcoin has steadied, trading atop of $3,700 after plummeting -14% yesterday. On tap: Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping plan to meet at the G-20 that starts on Friday. Fed Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida speaks in NY today and Chair Powell speaks tomorrow. G20 meeting is to be held in Argentina from Nov 30-Dec 1. 1. Global equities mixed results Japanese stocks rallied overnight, lifted by a gain stateside Monday and as a weaker yen supported exporters, although fresh concerns about Sino-U.S trade tensions capped gains. The Nikkei share average ended the day +0.64% higher, while the broader Topix added +0.73%. Down-under, Aussie stocks ended higher overnight, with financial stocks leading gains after regulators gave lenders more time to implement new capital rules on loans. The S&P/ASX 200 index climbed +1% at the close of trade after falling -0.78% Monday. In S. Korea, the Kospi stock index rallied, lifted by gains in auto shares, while investors remained cautious over Trump’s new trade remarks on the Sino-U.S trade quarrel. The Kospi was up +0.79%. In China, equities closed lower overnight after U.S President Trump seemed to nullify hopes of a trade truce with Beijing, while investors remained on the sidelines amid a slowdown in global growth. The Shanghai Composite index ended flat, while the blue-chip CSI300 index closed -0.1% lower. In Hong Kong, stocks eased slightly on Tuesday, as market remained wary of potential volatility inspired by this weekends G20 summit and the pace of interest rate hikes in the U.S. The Hang Seng index was down -0.2%, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises index fell -0.1%. In Europe, regional bourses trade mixed. The Italian budget and Brexit developments continue to be in the forefront – Italy confirmed their 2019 budget but was still considering lowering it, while the UK Parliament will vote on the proposed Brexit deal on the Dec 11. U.S equities are set to open little changed (-1%). Indices: Stoxx600 -0.15% at 357.80, FTSE -0.25% at 7,018.75, DAX -0.06% at 11,347.30, CAC-40 -0.03% at 4,993.28, IBEX-35 +0.24% at 9,113.15, FTSE MIB -0.12% at 19,210.50, SMI -0.40% at 8,893.50, S&P 500 Futures -0.11% 2. Oil falls on record Saudi output; eyes G20 and OPEC, gold lower Oil prices remain under pressure, depressed by record Saudi Arabian production, despite the kingdom trying to persuade other exporters to agree output cuts ahead of next week’s OPEC meeting. Brent crude oil is down -70c a barrel at +$59.78, while U.S light crude is -75c lower at +$50.88. Data Monday showed that Saudi Arabia raised oil production to an all-time high this month, pumping +11.1M to +11.3M bpd in November. Note: Oil prices are down -30% since early October, weighed down by an emerging supply overhang and widespread financial market weakness. The market is now waiting for the outcome of this weeks G20 meeting in S. America and next week’s OPEC meeting. Ahead of the U.S open, gold prices are a tad lower as the ‘big’ dollar holds firm outright, and while investors await for clues on the pace of future U.S interest rate hikes and the outcome of the G20 summit. Spot gold is -0.1% lower at +$1,220.97 per ounce, while U.S gold futures are down -0.2% at +$1,220.2 an ounce. 3. U.S trade worries pushes Bund yields to three-month lows German bund yields are trading atop of their three month lows this morning after President Trump brought global trade conflicts back into the fore, fuelling concerns about the outlook for the global economy. Trump said yesterday that he expects to raise tariffs on Chinese imports and also said that the Brexit agreement may make trade between the U.S and London more difficult. The yield on German 10-year Bunds has dropped -3 bps to +0.33%, its lowest print since early September. Elsewhere, the yield on 10-year Treasuries is unchanged at +3.05%, while in the U.K, the 10-year Gilt yield has fallen -3 bps to +1.375%, the lowest in more than a week. The spread of Italy’s 10-year BTP’s over Bunds has increased +2 bps to +2.9245%. 4. Dollar little changed President Trump is expected to move ahead with plan to increase China tariffs to +25% on $200B worth of goods – iPhones made in China could be included in new round of tariffs. Trumps ‘hawkish’ comments on trade is helping the U.S dollar to maintain a firm tone – his remarks are very much par for the course on attempted deal making. GBP/USD (£1.2759) trades atop of new two-week lows, as concerns over the upcoming Brexit vote remains a headwind for sterling. EUR/USD (€1.1317) is steady, as Italy appears to be less confrontational with a willingness to negotiate, as the government seems aware of the implications of its actions. Elsewhere, yen has decreased less than -0.05% to ¥113.60, the weakest in more than a week. 5. Aussie general election Australia’s conservative government are looking at a general election next May, as PM Morrison brings the budget forward to April 2. “It is absolutely our intention to deliver the budget before the election, and to deliver a surplus budget,” he says. The announcement means the election will be held on either May 11 or 18, with the minority government lagging badly behind Labor opponents in opinion surveys that indicate conservatives could lose as many as 20 seats. Morrison has indicated that a mid-year budget update would be delivered on Dec. 17. Note: PM Morrison has suffered another blow to his minority government’s position overnight with Victoria’s Julia Banks announcing her departure to stand as an independent due to frustration at internal party divisions over energy and climate-change policies, as well as women’s issues.

5e74a55a7dff7637532bdc7c	These Reliable Monthly Dividend Payers Have Never Been Cheaper	"A trio of reliable monthly dividend payers has been swept up in the pandemic panic. They could be the dirt-cheap buys that have dividend investors kicking themselves this time next year for not “backing up the truck” and buying every monthly paying share in sight. These closed-end funds (CEFs) as a whole are far smaller than their mutual and exchange-traded brethren, and they’re about as sexy as a doorstop, so they go completely ignored by traditional financial media. But a couple dozen of these have exhibited some downright admirable performance while the rest of the market is tanking around them. Better still? CEFs are, as a general rule, income monsters, and thus they’re among my favorite contrarian income plays for retirement accounts. And most importantly, these three in particular are bargains. Most stocks have been blasted because their business prospects suddenly look worse. But these funds have suffered modest declines while their net asset value (NAV) has remained steady or even grown. As a result, each CEF is trading at least twice as cheap as its historical discount to NAV. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Core Bond (BHK) Distribution Rate: 6.6% BlackRock Core Bond (BHK) is exactly what it sounds like: a fund that can provide investors with their only source of fixed-income exposure, if they wished. This wide basket of 1,390 bonds covers the gamut, from Treasuries and other U.S. agency securities to corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Importantly, at least 75% of BHK’s assets need to be used on investment-grade debt (at the time the fund purchased the bond), and that’s right where it sits at the moment. The largest slug of assets, 31.4%, are in the top-rated tier of debt (AAA). High-yield corporate junk is about 11% of the portfolio, so that has kept BHK mostly insulated from that implosion. Despite the relative stability of BlackRock Core Bond’s assets, panicky investors have lost their nerve of late and driven the CEF’s units far more than they deserved. The upshot for new investors? You can buy those assets for 88 cents on the dollar—a nearly 12% discount that’s almost double BHK’s five-year average discount to NAV of 7.6%. On top of that, you’re getting a 6%-plus yield via distributions that are delivered each and every month. Wall Street Scares Up a Bargain Opportunity Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Vance Municipal Income Trust (EVN) Distribution Rate: 5.5% Municipal bonds have held up awfully well so far, and in fact, many of the best-performing CEFs this year are of the muni-bond sort. Eaton Vance Municipal Income Trust (EVN) is among the funds in this tax-free crowd. Its 351 holdings are spread among 30 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, though they’re hardly spread out evenly. New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts munis alone make up nearly a third of assets, and more than three-quarters of all assets are held in the top nine states and Puerto Rico. Municipal bonds are a “sneaky” good income play most times. While the occasional default will send the financial world breathless, muni bonds are much safer than these cautionary tales would indicate, and 80% of EVN’s portfolio is at least investment-grade, including 42% in the second-highest debt tier of AA. EVN’s assets have been just a touch weaker than BHK’s, but the story here is the same: an overdone panic. As a result, Eaton Vance Municipal Income Trust trades at a mouth-watering 20% discount. That’s more than triple its five-year average discount of 4.3%. Bears Deliver a Treat to Muni Hunters BlackRock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust (BBN) Distribution Rate: 6.5% Every now and again, I field the question: “Why would anyone buy a taxable municipal bond? What’s the point?” And I’ll answer with a question: “What’s the point of holding tax-free bonds in a tax-advantaged account?” Tax exemption only matters if you can put it to use. If you can’t, then you’re simply eating lower yields for no good reason. Taxable muni bonds, on the other hand, sport higher yields than traditional munis but with relatively similar credit strength. BlackRock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust (BBN) is a collection of just more than 150 of these “black sheep” munis, tied to things such as utilities, transportation projects and health measures. And more than 90% of the fund is allocated to investment-grade bonds, which is an awfully safe way to get over a 6% yield, paid monthly. And yet … What Is Wall Street Looking At? The result is what, at least at the moment, looks like a steal—a discount of nearly 13% for a fund that typically only trades at 4% below NAV. That’s right: BBN’s net assets have actually gone up nearly 9% in value, but the fund’s price has dipped by more than 4%. How to Collect $3,000 in Dividends Each and Every Month The real question with these funds is just how much upside is left given that interest rates have been slashed into the ground. Their deep value prices will help provide modest price returns, but then what? I have even better income ideas outlined in my “Monthly Dividend Superstars” report. These little-known contrarian plays tick off every checkbox in the retirement wish list, including … This is the path less traveled. Most finance-TV pundits will tell you to sink your hard-earned retirement money into “can’t-miss” blue chips like the Dividend Aristocrats. They’ve grown their dividends for decades, and probably will for decades more. Ignore that nonsense. Those same Dividend Aristocrats only yield a little more than 2% on average, and the most established Aristocrats have slowed their dividend growth to a sloth’s pace. Worse, some of these “Aristocrats” might be kicked out of the club by this time next year, their artificially propped-up payouts exposed by a lethal dose of reality. If you retire with these kinds of stocks, your income stream will dry up so quickly that, within just a few years, you’ll be forced to hack away at your savings to pay your monthly bills. Don’t take that gamble. Pay your monthly bills with outsize monthly dividend checks, and use the leftover cash to take a couple trips, build that backyard pool or spoil your grandkids rotten.

5e5d08bebd5d9d5ac07275d3	Yen May Rise as Most New Coronavirus Cases Emerge Outside of China	As anticipated, the US Dollar started to focus on its role as the world’s reserve currency on Wednesday as sentiment cautiously deteriorated. Coronavirus fears remained front and center for the fundamental driver of equities. The S&P 500 closed -0.38% to the downside despite update local new home sales data for January. The anti-risk Japanese Yen also rose alongside the similarly-behaving Swiss Franc. Wuhan virus cases continued to rise, with the World Health Organization reporting that most of the new outbreaks are emerging outside of China. There were a couple of cases reported in Karachi, Pakistan. Germany’s Health Minister Jens Spahn said that the country is at the beginning of a corona epidemic. Sentiment-linked crude oil prices closed at their lowest since January 2019 with the markets increasing Fed rate cut bets. S&P 500 futures are pointing lower in the aftermath of a press conference hosted by U.S. President Donald Trump on the coronavirus. During his speech, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that the first domestic coronavirus case of unknown origin was reported. A lack of critical economic event risk places the focus for foreign exchange markets on sentiment. The Yen could have further room to rally at the expense of its sentiment-linked counterparts such as the Australian Dollar. The S&P 500 is increasingly at risk to a medium-term bearish shift in the technical outlook. The near-term USD/JPY technical bias still seems to be pointing to the downside. Zooming in on the 4-hour chart, the pair has been in a downtrend since last week’s high. This is being maintained by falling resistance – pink lines on the chart below. If this continues holding, we may see USD/JPY eventually retest key rising support from August which if taken out, risks shifting the bias further bearish.

5e612950ce606d0f9b77a8b3	Canadian Dollar Price Outlook: USD/CAD Rally at Risk- NFP Levels	The Canadian Dollar is softer against the US Dollar this week with USD/CAD setting its weekly opening range just below the technical resistance near the February highs. The rally may be vulnerable heading into tomorrows US Non-Farm Payroll & Canada employment releases as price struggles near trend extremes. These are the updated targets and invalidation levels that matter on the USD/CAD price charts heading into Jobs Friday. Review my latest Weekly Strategy Webinar for an in-depth breakdown of this Loonie trade setup and more. Chart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Technical Strategist; USD/CAD on Tradingview Technical Outlook: In my last Canadian Dollar Price Outlook we cited that the USD/CAD breakout was, “approaching the first major resistance hurdle on this multi-week advance.” The level in focus was 1.3383/92 with a breach / close above, “needed to validate a larger reversal in price with such a scenario exposing channel resistance (red) / the 2017 open at 1.3435.” Note that the March open registered at 1.3433 - price briefly registered a high at 1.3465 before reversing sharply with daily resistance steady at this threshold. A breach / close above is needed to fuel the next leg higher with subsequent resistance objectives eyed at the upper parallel / 78.6% retracement at 1.3512. Initial daily support steady at 1.3330/35 with broader bullish invalidation at 1.3276. Notes: A closer look at Loonie price action sees USD/CAD continuing to trade within the confines of an ascending pitchfork formation extending off October / December lows with the median-line offering support this week. The weekly opening-rangeis set and we’re looking for the break for guidance with the immediate long-bias at risk while below last week’s high. A break lower would look to challenge 1.3269/76- look for a bigger reaction there IF reached – a break lower would expose the 50% retracement / uncovered close at 1.3208/21. Channel resistance is eyed at 1.3480s with the next major resistance level at 1.3512. Bottom line: The USD/CAD rally is testing broader downtrend resistance with the immediate advance vulnerable heading into major event risk tomorrow. From a trading standpoint, a good spot to reduce long-exposure / raise protective stops. Look for possible topside exhaustion on a spike tomorrow with a break below the 1.32-handle ultimately needed to suggest a more significant high was registered last week.

5e81b5dcc496d2354de73005	Dovish Central Banks Support the U.S dollar	Thursday April 25: Five things the markets are talking about European equites are under pressure while U.S futures tread water as investors continue to analyze a plethora of corporate earnings against a backdrop of global growth concerns. Note: To date, +80% of S&P 500 companies results have beaten market expectations. The ‘big’ dollar continues to trade atop of its four-month high against G10 currency pairs, while U.S Treasuries are little changed alongside German Bunds which again trade in negative territory. The EUR is printing new two-year lows outright while the yen found some temporary support after the Bank of Japan (BoJ) cut its economic growth forecasts and committed to keeping rates low. Sterling is little changed despite some Conservative party members wanting to know when PM May would be leaving. The Swedish kroner, similar to the loonie’s reaction yesterday, has been stunned by the Riksbank ‘dovish’ tone after this morning’s interest rate announcement (see below). On tap: Japan’s Shinzo Abe will meet E.U leaders today before flying to the U.S for a summit with Trump. All eyes are on tomorrow’s advance Q1 U.S GDP release (08:30 am EDT). Investors are looking for clues on how the U.S economy responded to Trump’s government shutdown and fallout from the Q4 market rout. 1. Stocks follow Wall Street lower In Japan, the Nikkei rallied to a five-month high overnight as a number of corporate earnings turned out to be ‘less bad’ than the market had feared. Japan’s central bank was also supportive, revising its guidance to say it expected not to increase interest rates for at least another year. The Nikkei 225 rallied +0.48%, while the broader Topix rallied +0.51%. Down-under, Australia’s ASX 200 was closed for ANZAC day. In S. Korea, the Kospi index was down -0.5% after a fourth-straight month of declining exports dragged on the local economy. South Korean GDP shrank in Q1 by -0.3%, its worst performance in more than a decade. Stocks in China and Hong Kong were also lower even though the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) signaled support for the economy by saying it had no intention of tightening monetary policy. At the close, the Shanghai Composite index was down -2.23%, while the blue-chip CSI300 index slipped -2.19%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was down -0.86%. In Europe, regional bourses trade mostly lower following a mixed session in Asia overnight, with notable weakness in China. U.S stocks are set to open little changed (+0.06%). Indices: Stoxx600 -0.08% at 390.58, FTSE -0.30% at 7,449.21, DAX +0.04% at 12,317.92, CAC-40 -0.10% at 5,570.56, IBEX-35 +0.07% at 9,462.92, FTSE MIB +0.15% at 21,757.50, SMI +0.27% at 9,681.50, S&P 500 Futures +0.06 2. Brent oil prints $75 for first time this year amid tighter Iran sanctions Brent crude (BCO) oil has rallied above +$75 a barrel for the first time this year on the back of tighter sanctions on Iran, while gains in West Texas Intermediate (WTI) have been curtailed by a surge in U.S supply. Brent crude futures briefly touched +$75.01 per barrel and is currently at +$74.90 per barrel, up +33c or +0.4% from yesterday’s close. U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures are at +$65.94 per barrel, up +5c. Brent has been receiving support from a halt of Russian oil exports to Poland and Germany via a pipeline due to quality concerns and also from the U.S announcement this week that it would end all exemptions for sanctions against Iran, demanding countries to halt oil imports from Tehran from May. Note: Brent prices are up +40% year-to-date. Weighing on U.S prices is data from the API last week showing that U.S. crude stocks rose by +6.9M barrels, more than expected, while U.S commercial crude oil inventories hit an October 2017 high of +460.63M barrels according to the EIA’s report yesterday. That was a rise of +1.3M barrels. Ahead of the U.S open, gold prices have edged a tad higher as a dip in equities and weak S. Korean GDP data overnight is raising some red flags about the pace of global economic growth. Nevertheless, a stronger USD is capping gold price gains. Spot gold has rallied +0.2% to +$1,277.72 per ounce, while U.S gold futures are steady at +$1,279.60 an ounce. 3. Central banks continue with dovish surprise on rate outlook Earlier this morning Sweden’s Riksbank tweaked its forward guidance so that the Repo Rate would remain at current level for somewhat longer period of time than was forecasted back in February – the next potential rate hike is near year-end or in early 2020 (revised from H2 of 2019). The Riksbank also extended its QE program and would buy government bonds for nominal value of SEK45B from July 2019 to December 2020. In Japan, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) kept its policy steady but clarified its forward guidance to reinforce it will not hike anytime soon. Governor Kuroda in his press conference stated that it was “possible that the time frame under forward guidance could exceed the spring of 2020 thus could keep low rates beyond that time period.” He reiterated that a “virtuous economic cycle was in place but consumer prices had remained somewhat weak,” and expects CPI to pick up towards the +2% target “gradually but likely would take time.” Elsewhere, German 10-year Bund yields dropped back into negative territory yesterday and are lower this morning at -0.017%. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields also fell yesterday, but are marginally higher ahead of the U.S open at +2.523%. 4. Loonie falls as BoC sees slower growth The USD continues to hold onto its recent gains as weak overseas inflation and GDP data support the ‘buck.’ The Canadian dollar (C$1.3517) is weaker, trading at its lowest level outright, since early January, after the BoC held its key interest rate steady yesterday and lowered its growth forecast for this year, signaling that further rate increases are unlikely in the near term. By dropping any reference to future rate hikes, Governor Poloz delivered his most ‘dovish’ signal in two-years. EUR/USD (€1.1136) is trading softer and is not too far off its July 2017 low print. The recent soft IFO data out of Germany this week is not helping the currency nor are the economic and political concerns in Italy. The ECB’s recent economic bulletin also stressed that risks in the Eurozone are “tilted to the downside.” USD/JPY (¥111.79) could not sustain any momentum above the psychological ¥112 handle despite the BoJ keeping its monetary policy steady and clarifying its forward guidance to reinforce it would not hike anytime soon. The SEK ($9.5601) has come under extreme pressure outright (down -1.46%) after the Riksbank put a more dovish spin on its rate path. Riksbank tweaked its forward guidance so that the Repo Rate would remain at current level for longer. EUR/SEK is higher by over +1.25% to test above €10.65 level. 5. UK April CBI retailing reported sales 13 vs. 0e Data from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) this morning showed that retail sales grew for the first time since November 2018 in the year to April. The survey of retailers, showed that sales volumes rose for the first time in five months, likely supported by the later timing of Easter this year. 49% of retailers said that sales volumes were up in April on a year ago, whilst 36% said they were down, giving a balance of +13%. This was broadly in line with expectations (+15%) Digging deeper, orders placed on suppliers also grew and are expected to pick up further in the month ahead, with sales volumes also set to see somewhat faster growth. Note: The readings are an indicator of short-term trends in the retail and wholesale sector of the UK economy. This article is for general information purposes only.

5e8cac672e31e82691980b66	Pound rallies as risk appetite returns, traders await news on Johnson	LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling rallied on Tuesday with a broad rebound in risk markets encouraging some selling of the dollar, while traders awaited news on British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is stable in intensive care as he battles COVID-19 symptoms. Johnson, 55, was moved into intensive care late on Monday after his condition deteriorated rapidly over the preceding 24 hours. His foreign minister is deputizing for him to lead the government’s response to the outbreak. Analysts said that while news of Johnson’s condition was clearly a concern, beyond a short-lived dip in Asian hours it had not yet moved the pound because it was unlikely to mean a change in the government’s policy direction to fight the virus. “Certainly, losing the head of government is not going to inject ‘confidence’ into the FX market, but government policy in a non-presidential system is ultimately crafted by the PM and his/her close advisers,” said Stephen Gallo, head of European FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets. “It’s also far too early to know what the PM being incapacitated or not making it out of the hospital will mean for UK economic and Brexit policy 3 to 6 months out. When there are too many moving parts, as we saw with the entire Brexit process, sometimes the British pound just simply does nothing.” Against the dollar, sterling extended its overnight gains in London, rising more than 1.2% to as high as $1.2383 before settling at $1.2321. The dollar, long seen as a safe haven, surged last month when investors panicked about the economic consequences of government-enforced lockdowns to fight the coronavirus. Sterling fell to as low as $1.1413 - its weakest since 1985. But the greenback has dropped this week and stock markets have rebounded sharply as investors welcome signs the rate of new infections across Europe and parts of the United States is peaking. Against the euro, sterling did far less well and was down 0.2% at 88.38 pence. In a sign of a healthy appetite for British assets, government bonds attracted their strongest investor demand since 2005. Britain held two bond auctions in a day for the first time and aims to sell a record 45 billion pounds of government bonds this month. Rabobank analysts said investors should remain cautious because of the challenge governments will face in designing exit strategies from the lockdowns they have imposed. “In short, short-squeezes might encourage risk on; but the virus situation arguably requires a far more sceptical stance,” they said, referring to optimism that economies can return to normal once lockdowns are lifted. “We likely face a long, hard road before things get back to where they were at the start of the year – if they ever can now the policy genies we have unleashed are out of the bottle.” Reporting by Tommy Reggiori Wilkes; Additional reporting by Sujata Rao and Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Nick Tattersall	GBP
5e954b7d391f1d202e91dba2	EUR Futures: Dips remain shallow	Open interest and volume went down by around 1.2K contracts and by nearly 95.5K contracts, respectively, at the beginning of the week according to preliminary readings from CME Group. EUR/USD started the week on a negative note, although the move was accompanied by declining open interest and volume, in turn supporting the view that further pullbacks are expected to remain somewhat limited. That said, a move to the 1.0990 resistance region remains well on the cards for the time being.	EUR
5e878ae178f3271784de3c1a	Bears Continue To Enjoy Upper Hand	After Wednesday’s slide, the S&P 500 moved higher yesterday. While the move itself hadn’t surprised us as we’ve earlier called for a pause in the downswing, the question is whether we can expect some more upside shortly. Long story short, that’s unlikely. Let’s open today’s analysis with the daily chart examination (charts courtesy of http://stockcharts.com). Considering Wednesday’s bearish gap, stocks have retraced a measly part of the preceding decline. Let’s recall our Wednesday’s observations: Stocks closed near the daily lows on Tuesday, and did so on higher volume than was the case on Monday. Another point speaking for the bears is that yesterday’s upswing attempt was again soundly rejected. And still, the daily indicators are increasingly and tellingly curling lower. After Thursday’s session, the daily indicators are overall positioned more bearishly than the day before, lending credibility to the claim of yesterday’s session being merely a pause in the downswing. The bearish gap continues to support the sellers, and we certainly expect the downside move to continue over the coming days. But doesn’t yesterday’s action in the high-yield corporate debt (HYG ETF) constitute a fly in the ointment? After all, the intraday move made us issue this intraday Alert yesterday after the regular Stock Trading Alert was published: Stocks not merely paused, but also slightly recovered during today’s session so far to trade slightly below 2500 currently. Yet, it’s the corporate debt market that is the reason behind this intraday Alert. It recovered and the bulls attempted to close yesterday’s sizable gap. Despite their failure and HYG trading close to its yesterday’s closing prices, stocks are trading higher than they were yesterday – in line with the discussed need to pause in their downswing. However, should HYG continue its recovery attempts, that wouldn’t be without consequences for the S&P 500. While we continue to think that the stock downswing will carry on in the coming days, it makes sense to tighten the trade position’s parameters and improve its risk-reward ratio. Let’s quote from yesterday’s regular Alert first as it explains why the debt market is key to stocks: Comparing the magnitude of yesterday’s downswing shows that stocks are a bit ahead in the sliding game. Unless HYG declines more meaningfully today, stocks are likely to take a short-term pause as they have declined more profoundly yesterday. The emphasis here goes to short-term (which implies that any potential upswing certainly isn’t going to be a tradable opportunity) – unless we see a turnaround in the debt market, any potential stock upswing doesn’t really have legs. Now, we’ll take a joint look at the HYG action that made us cautious: The upswing ran farther than expected, and while the odds remain stacked against its possible repetition, it pays to be reasonably suspicious and conservative in one’s trading decisions. After all, we’re in it for the long run and in order to help people fulfill their many dreams. Summing up, the bears enjoy the upper hand as can be seen on both the weekly and daily charts. The renewed downswing is under way, and lower SP 500 (and SPY (NYSE:SPY) ETF) values are ahead. The daily indicators, high-yield corporate debt market and fundamental prospects of more coronavirus pain and its reflection in market prices mean that our open and increasingly profitable short position remains justified.

5e6eca773765014aaed25144	Yen jumps as traders seek safety despite Fed's slashing rates	"Japan's yen surged 2% on Monday with traders seeking cover in safe-haven currencies as fears about the coronavirus trumped central bank efforts to ease the pain, while the dollar stood tall despite the U.S. Federal Reserve slashing rates to zero. The Fed cut U.S. interest rates on Sunday and said it would expand its balance sheet by at least $700 billion in the coming weeks. The Bank of Japan said at an emergency meeting it would buy more corporate bonds, commercial debt and establish a new corporate lending scheme. New Zealand's central bank has also slashed rates in an emergency move. But equity markets slumped again on Monday as traders fretted about the growing number of coronavirus cases worldwide. In FX, investors dumped riskier currencies and bought into those they consider safer, although the size of the moves was not as large as last week. MUFG analysts said policymakers could reduce volatility, but ""the ultimate determinant will of course be evidence that COVID-19 is peaking"". The dollar dropped 2% to as low as 105.70 yen. That was still above last Monday's 101.18 yen. The Swiss franc, another currency considered a safe haven, rose versus the dollar, with the dollar down 0.6% at 0.945 francs. The franc was unchanged versus the euro at 1.055 francs but near four-and-a-half-year highs. The dollar, measured against a basket of currencies, was last up 0.1% at 97.95, off the day's highs. It had been falling as traders sold because of collapsing Treasury yields, but the U.S. currency has rebounded the past week as panicked investors stocked up on the world's most liquid currency. The euro jumped 0.5% to $1.1168 after earlier reaching $1.124. Sterling sank as low as $1.2250, its weakest since October. Volatility, which had doubled in a few weeks, has subsided in both euro/dollar and across currencies, though it remained elevated. The People's Bank of China injected 100 billion yuan ($14.28 billion) into financial institutions on Monday. The move came minutes before data showed China's retail sales, industrial output, and fixed-asset investment all tumbled in January and February. ""The measures introduced to stop the spread of the virus in China may have led to a sharper slowdown in activity than will be the case elsewhere, but it's clear that the measures central banks have taken, and whatever they do next, cannot prevent a major economic hit being felt globally,"" Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes said. The offshore yuan rose 0.1% at 7.0206 yuan per dollar. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut rates by 75 basis points to a record 0.25%. The Reserve Bank of Australia added A$5.9 billion ($3.63 billion) to the banking system. The New Zealand and Australian dollars fell 0.3% but were off the day's lows. Currencies hit hard by risk aversion, such as the Russian rouble, Mexican peso and Norwegian crown, fell in many cases towards record lows."	JPY
5e78d09af687663f26028861	Dollar drops after Fed unveils unprecedented measures to lend, backstop debt	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar dropped on Monday after the U.S. Federal Reserve took unprecedented steps to backstop a range of debt in an attempt to offset the “severe disruptions” to the economy caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The steps include establishment of new programs that will lend against student loans, credit card loans, and U.S. government backed-loans to small businesses, as well as new programs to buy bonds of larger employers and make loans to them. Existing purchases of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities will be expanded as much as needed “to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions and the economy.” “There’s no doubting that the Fed is doing everything within its power to see the economy through this period of unbelievable turmoil,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe. Investors are now waiting on the U.S. government to pass stimulus to support the economy. “I think the one thing we really need to see is more fiscal ammunition coming to the fore,” said Mazen Issa, senior currency strategist at TD Securities in New York. “You’ve got to think about those that are asked to be socially distant and stay home from work and not earn a paycheck and they’re taking their time to make them whole. They need to speed it up.” Senate Democrats objected to a $1 trillion-plus stimulus bill on Sunday as being overly weighted towards corporate interests at the expense of healthcare workers, hospitals and state and local governments. The dollar index against a basket of peers was last 101.79, down 0.7% on the day. The dollar had gained earlier before the Fed action as stocks plunged, raising concerns that the multiple central bank actions so far to ease liquidity across markets have not been effective. The euro was last up 0.98% against the greenback at $1.0799. The U.S. currency’s earlier rise was also fuelled by a turnaround in dollar positions among hedge funds to a net short from an overall long bet, according to latest positioning data. That raised speculation that the dollar’s rally could be partly explained by short-covering by traders.

5e74a55a7dff7637532bdc7d	With Markets Under Siege, It's Time To Consider Serious Portfolio Adjustment	This post was written exclusively for Investing.com With the stock market in an unprecedented period of volatility, we are all sometimes forced to make tough decisions. The recent turn of events around the potential impact of the coronavirus has unfolded with incredible speed, leaving many to wonder what could happen next, and no clear answer. While global markets are today rising along with energy companies getting a boost from U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion he may intervene in the Saudi-Russian oil price war, the bigger picture remains murky and difficult to assess. Before yesterday's uptick, the S&P 500 had plummeted 30% in just four weeks and it's anyone guess what tomorrow may bring. The increased uncertainty, rising levels of volatility, and potential for a slow economic recovery have resulted in the shifting of assets in my portfolio, reducing my equity holdings, and raising cash. With my fear that the economic outlook could grow even worse and the potential for the stock market to fall further, it seemed to be the right thing to do. Global Risks Global stock markets have so far failed to respond decisively to many of the actions that the central banks around the world have taken to try to calm nerves. Even with fiscal policy in many countries now on the table, the equity markets continue to fall. It indicates a few points of concern, with one being that the future is very uncertain or that the policies governments and central banks are taking may not be enough to solve the potential fallout. The lack of convinced response from the equity markets seems to present the most significant concern. Estimates May Be Too High Additionally, it seems possible that the current environment could severely impact companies' performances as governments try to slow the spread of the virus by closing borders, and in some cases shutting down. It could result in some companies seeing a whole quarter or two of reduced revenue and earnings, and that means that earnings estimates for the broader S&P 500 may be too high. If it does turn out that earnings are too high, then the value for the S&P 500 is not as cheap as it looks. Currently, S&P Dow Jones estimates earnings in 2020 of $169.94 and for $191.05 for 2021. It gives the S&P 500 a PE ratio of about 14.2 and 12.6, based on the indexes level of 2,409.40 on March 19. However, using a multiple that is closer to the historical average of roughly 16, the current level for the S&P 500 suggests earnings of approximately $151 per share in 2020, which would be a decline from 2019 earnings of $157.10. It seems possible given the severity of the steps taken to thwart the coronavirus, the impact to 2020 earnings could be more significant than a 4% decline from last year. Companies May Re-Emerge Different Additionally, not all companies will emerge from this period, as brief or as long as it may be, the same as when they entered it. In some cases, it could mean a changed business model. Also, the market is likely to revalue specific sectors, meaning some stocks and sectors may not receive the same earnings or sales multiple they had before this event. It leaves investors uncertain of what lies ahead and, at this point, unsure of what the potential impact to one’s stocks may be. For me, it resulted in a painful process of having to give up on some companies that I have held for multiple years because I simply do not know how they will emerge from this environment, nor how long it will take for the business to recover. At this point, with equities influx, raising the cash portion of my holdings, while reducing some of the stocks that have more uncertain futures, seemed like the right thing to do. It does, in the end, create new opportunities down the road. Disclaimer: Mott Capital Management, LLC is a registered investment adviser.

5e81b594c496d2354de72fcc	King Dollar’s reign could end on Powell’s testimony and trade war progress	How big will the punch bowl be this time around? Financial markets are convinced the Fed is set to commence on an easing cycle this summer, but if we see Fed Fund futures price in only two rate cuts this year, US stocks will struggle to make fresh highs and the highly anticipated dollar reversal may not come to fruition. Friday’s blockbuster US non-farm payroll report tentatively derailed stock and equity bullish plans. The needle was moved from a slight lean towards 3 rate cuts to two cuts. The dollar’s broad gains accompanied a surge with US Treasury yields and a pullback in stocks. The focus will now shift to incremental updates on the trade front and a plethora of Fed speak and the Minutes to last month’s decision. US inflation data will be released but other indications do not point for a significant surprise rise. The release of China’s trade figures will show how resilient their economy was during the tensest moments in the trade war. With the PBOC waiting to stimulate their economy, we could see dismal data support earlier action. Regarding trade, we will need to see meaningful updates or scheduled trips to DC or Beijing to support optimism that both sides are closing the gap. A wrath of Fed speak will see investors search for clues if the Fed waiver on its signal for a July rate cut. Euro Stimulus bets from the ECB may grow if we continue to see a trend of softer than expected data out of Germany. The brewing trade war between the US and Europe will likely to continue to weigh on car manufacturers, with Germany bearing the brunt of the troubles. Industrial production on a monthly basis is expected to rebound, but following a very disappointing factory orders reading, we should not be surprised if the German data comes in softer. If we see Lagarde become the ECB Chief, we could see fiscal stimulus expectations rise, which should be very positive for both growth and the euro. Draghi’s ECB has stated they are in no rush to deliver a rate cut this month, but if the data continues to show significant slowdowns, a 20 basis-point cut could happen this month. CAD The Bank of Canada (BOC) is widely expected to keep rates steady, with only one economist calling for a 25-basis point cut. Monetary policy is expected to remain on hold for the rest of the year, as the recent data has been surprisingly better than expected, not counting Friday’s cool labor market number. Employment has been on a tear, with the first half being the best start since 2002. Oil The crude selloff that stemmed from global slowdown concerns appears to be fully priced in. West Texas Intermediate crude may find key support from the mid-$50-barrel area. Oil got a boost on an improving outlook for demand on a surprising robust US nonfarm payroll report. Fresh stimulus bets are still strong for the Fed to deliver a rate cut at the end of July and for the other big three banks, the PBOC, ECB and BOJ, to remain active in delivering additional stimulus. If we do see US and China come through with scheduling face-to-face talks, we could see markets again to price in further optimism we could see a deal done this year. Global demand would get a reprieve if China and US could finalize a trade deal. Geopolitical risks are also keeping a bid in place for oil as Iran continues to increase their nuclear activities. Up until now, most of Europe has been trying to negotiate with Tehran, but if Iran continues to with their nuclear agenda, we could see deeper international sanctions that could completely cripple Iran’s economy. Gold Gold lost some of its mojo after a robust nonfarm payroll report eased up dovish bets on the Fed. The overall outlook for bullion is still looking bright as gold ETF inflows appears insuppressible. Robust demand for the yellow metal will continue to be supported on the backdrop of expectations of fresh stimulus to be released by the four largest central banks. Bitcoin The cryptocurrency markets have been on a mission to deliver wide range interest that will attract retail, institutional and mainstream commerce interest over the past several weeks. With social media giant Facebook entering the digital coin space, all coins have benefited on renewed interest. Bitcoin remains the bellwether that has yet to be threatened by other altcoins and we should not be surprised if it eventually makes a complete recovery of the $16,000 plummet that started at the end of 2017.

5e5ecb80c3ed99267a3f33bb	New Zealand Dollar Forecast: NZD/USD Declines Despite Fed Cut	Kiwi weakness appears set to continue this week as the New Zealand Dollar broke through a multi-year low against the US Dollar earlier this week. NZDUSD saw a modest, but brief jump this morning following an emergency 50 basis rate cut from the US Federal Reserve. The unexpected move from the Fed briefly lifted risk aversion across markets before giving way to risk-off sentiment. The RBNZ is set to meet on the 25th of this month and markets are pricing in an increased chance for deeper cuts than last week, but still fall short of pricing in two full cuts. Still, the increased chance for more easing from the RBNZ is not helping Kiwi weakness as traders continue to shift positions out of risk sensitive assets and currencies. Weakness looks set to continue with the spread of the coronavirus, now formally named Covid-19, continuing across the globe. Fears over a worldwide pandemic have sparked worry from global policy makers and central bankers alike, although fiscal stimulus measures have lagged its monetary counterpart. However, Grant Robertson, New Zealand’s Finance Minister said last week that the government could ease fiscal policy in the upcoming May budget. The Finance Minister also said that New Zealand’s economic fundamentals remain strong. Echoing that call, home prices for February increased 5.3 percent, bolstering evidence that the countries housing market is continuing to improve on the back of lower rates. Risk reversals, which measure the difference between implied volatility of calls and puts, is showing continued expected downside from traders. The various risk tenors displayed in the chart below displays traders positioned for a downside move over the next few weeks and months in the NZDUSD cross.

5e95b176b1fd04303af01e6b	Positive risk bias amid exit strategies discussion, earnings season eyed [Video]	As traders get back to their desks following a long Easter weekend, they are met by markets hinting at a fairly constructive appetite for risk. The discussion over exit strategies across the major economies following their periods of lockdown is playing into this improvement in market sentiment, as has better than expected Chinese trade data. With several countries in Europe now beginning to ease lockdown restrictions, President Trump suggests that the US is close to completing its own plan to re-open the country. However, we will begin to get some clarity on the scale of the impact on first quarter corporate data as earnings season kicks off this week. It could make very sobering reading. The big banks report this week, with JP Morgan and Wells Fargo in focus today. Furthermore, although the recovery on equity markets continues today, there is still a significant risk that they are simply bear market rallies. We have not seen the scale of second wave of COVID-19 infections/deaths yet, something that should become a factor as economies reduce restrictions on the movement of their populations once more. For now, the recovery is still progressing, but for how long? Treasury yields are higher, the US dollar less strong, and equities also stronger. After a weekend of tense negotiations amongst major oil producers, driving price volatility, oil is relatively settled today. With estimates of well over 20m barrels of oil per day out of demand, are the OPEC+ production cuts even going to make a difference? Wall Street closed lower last night (SP 500 -1.0% at 2761) but with the E-mini SP futures +1.2% today there is a decent look to the equities space this morning. Asian markets were positive (Nikkei +3.1%, Shanghai Composite +1.4%) whilst European markets are around 1% higher in early moves. In forex, there is a mild risk positive bias with USD slightly negative across the majors (aside from the underperforming JPY). In commodities, oil is supported early today around a half to 1% higher, whilst gold and silver are trading around the flat line. There are no key economic data releases schedules for today. With a strong move higher into Thursday’s close, the FTSE 100 finally managed to follow other major indices in a breakout above the initial March recovery high. Now for the more important part, holding on to the breakout. Futures are looking promising early today as the bulls look to confirm a sustainable breakout. The technical set up is also encouraging, with RSI at a two month high above 50, whilst MACD and Stochastics are also well set in their recoveries. In the wake of last week’s move above 5815, there is now a run of higher lows and higher highs, which is a new trend formation. If the market closes back below the 5815 breakout, it will be a disappointment, but whilst a three week recovery trend is intact, the bulls will remain encouraged (comes in at 5600 today) to buy into weakness. Support of a higher low at 5590 adds further weight to this trend, whilst on the hourly chart momentum is still in recovery mode (RSI consistently bottoming 40/50). So we would still be looking to use any intraday weakness into support as a chance to buy. For upside targets, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement (of 7690/4899) is the immediate target at 5965 but there is very little resistance overhead and 50% Fib (the equivalent of around where the S&P 500 currently sits) at 6295. Holding above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at 5558 maintains the recovery outlook for recovery. Ultimately, though the key will be sustaining the key higher low at 5352. There has been a huge amount of drama and trading volatility on oil in recent sessions as the prospect of production cuts has been argued over by the major oil producers. As the dust settles on the agreed reductions, the market is still cautious. With three huge negative candles in the past four sessions, and a run of four lower closes in the past five, the trend is one of selling into intraday strength. However, the more optimistic traders will point to the fact that there has not been an instant bottom falling out of the market (the $19.27 key support remains intact) and there is a relatively stable market early today. How traders respond today could be crucial. The hourly chart shows hugely erratic moves, but how the market responds to resistance between $23.50/$25.25 (effectively still a mid-range pivot band) will give a strong indication of where the market is at. Failure to reclaim this pivot band will retain a corrective bias, and selling into strength for a drift towards $19.27. A close above $25.25 would change this. On a session of slightly thin trading the Dow closed lower as the bulls just took their foot off the gas of the recovery. Thursday’s breakout came with a slightly cautious candle and this was reflected in yesterday’s session. However, given the strength and support of the key breakout above 22,595 the bulls are looking to continue the run higher. What is remarkable about this recovery is the reaction to the Fibonacci retracements of the 29,567/18,213 massive sell-off. They have been key turning points at every step of the recovery. The use of 23.6% Fib as support two weeks ago saw a rally through to 50% Fib (around 23,890) which formed the basis of resistance on Thursday. That after 38.2% (at 22,550) was the resistance for the first rebound high. With an uptrend of the recovery at 22,665 we look to use yesterday’s weakness as a springboard for the next run higher. We favour a continuation of this recovery, with a retest of 50% Fib and the resistance at 24,009before a continuation towards 61.8% Fib at 25,230. The importance of 38.2% Fib (given it is also the breakout) and the breakout band 22,480/22,595 is significant now.

5e7a520560f2c26ef602016c	CAC 40 & FTSE 100 Forecasts: Indices Gain Despite Horrid PMI Data	Tuesday saw the release of PMI data for Eurozone economies and the United States, all of which revealed an expected decline in economic activity due to the coronavirus pandemic. Nevertheless, the CAC 40 and FTSE 100 climbed off their recent lows and bullishness spilled over into the first half of the New York trading session. Consequently, the two European indices may take aim at early areas of resistance – should bullishness continue. In the case of the CAC 40, it seems a Fibonacci level near 3,500 has helped to temporarily ward off further losses which has allowed the index to make a run at prior support. Posting a daily close around 4,200, CAC traders may take aim at resistance around 4,500 which is derived from the December 2018 low and sparked minor price indecision during the index’s decline earlier in March. While there is little to suggest the index is due for a reversal higher, a daily close above the level would be an encouraging development for chartists as it may allow for a subsequent extension beyond. That being said, IG Client Sentiment data reveals retail traders are essentially split down the middle, offering a mixed trading bias. Shifting over to the FTSE 100, recent price action reveals a dramatic decline to two-fold support from 2010 and a more-recent Fibonacci sequence near 4,840. Together, the levels likely played a role in stalling losses and the FTSE can now look to retake 5,500 where yet another Fibonacci level rests alongside the 2016 lows. Should the recovery effort continue, the zone will likely be an early barrier standing in the way of a larger extension higher. In the meantime, fundamental developments will likely come in the form of coronavirus updates – not economic data as it is widely accepted upcoming prints will miss expectations. Therefore, encouraging price developments like higher highs and higher lows may help simplify the chaos of the fundamental side as global equity markets attempt to stem the bleeding. --Written by Peter Hanks, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com Contact and follow Peter on Twitter @PeterHanksFX	GBP
5e9613e880b4bd2b2c881796	Bank of Canada likely to pause in April – Wells Fargo	On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada (BoC) will have its monetary policy meeting. According to analysts at Wells Fargo, after a busy March, the central bank will introduce no changes at the April meeting. “March was a particularly active month for the Bank of Canada (BoC). The central bank cut its policy interest rates a cumulative 150 bps to just 0.25%, while also introducing a raft of other measures. These measures included, among other things, purchases of mortgage bonds and provincial money market paper, a Bankers Acceptance purchase facility, a commercial paper purchase program, and also C$5 billion purchases per week of Canadian government securities. The BoC also launched the Standing Term Liquidity Facility to provide liquidity to the financial system.” “After such a busy March we expect the BoC to pause in April, and do not expect any changes to the policy rate or other policy measures. The announcement will not be without interest however as the central bank will provide updated economic forecasts in its Monetary Policy Report, which will provide the BoC’s clearest indication yet of the negative impact of the COVID-19 virus on Canada’s economy.”	CAD
5e62a8f0daad8d46b8f89fee	Dollar Remains In The Dumps	Dollar in the dumps NFP on tap Nikkei -2.72% DAX -2.49% UST 10Y 0.77% Oil $45/bbl Gold $1677/oz BTC/USD $9147 Europe and Asia: No Data North America: USD NFP 8:30 CAD Employment 8:30 Markets were generally quiet but with a decidedly risk-off slant with equity futures down another -1.25% in morning European trade while the dollar remained in the dumps as 10-year yields hit their lowest rates on record. The UST 10 year yield as was as low as 77 basis points indicating an almost universal rush to safety as investors begin to appreciate the global economic impact of the coronavirus. Globally the caseload has crossed the 100K mark and many experts fear that the US may be the next hotspot as travelers from Italy have brought the virus onshore to both East and West coasts. While the absolute number of US cases is only in the hundreds at this time, experts expect that figure to explode given the fact the US has not tested any of its population for infection. More troubling still is the fact that in the case of Italy fully 10% of patients require ICU treatment suggesting that the coronavirus may have morphed into a more virulent strain. The very early US cases also show a greater than expected number of serious infections and if the new strain of coronavirus is indeed more powerful that will almost certainly bring much of US economic activity to a halt. Against that backdrop, today’s NFPs are likely to carry little weight in the market as traders will view the data as stale. Indeed much of the risk in NFPs today is asymmetric. If the number is slightly better the market is likely to ignore it. If, however, the NFP misses its mark it would only add salt to the wound indicating that the US economy was already softening before the coronavirus and may now fall into a recession under the current strain. That, in turn, could push US yields even lower and will likely send USDJPY through a test of the 105.00 level.	USD

5e81b610c496d2354de7304f	USD/CAD – Canada hits highest inflation rate in seven years	Data from Stats Canada showed that inflation unexpectedly accelerated in the last month of 2018. Sharper costs for phone services and food were offset by lower gas prices, which pushed up the average inflation rate for all of 2018 to the highest level in seven-years. Canada’s December CPI print rose +2% y/y vs. a +1.7% rise in November. The market was expecting a no change of +1.7% on the month. For all of 2018, CPI rose +2.3%, following gains of +1.6% in 2017 and +1.4% in 2016. The Bank of Canada (BoC) preferred measures for inflation was unchanged compared to November, with the average annual gain for the three core-inflation gauges holding firm at +1.9%. BoC sets rate policy to achieve and maintain +2% inflation. USD/CAD has come under pressure since the release, -0.22% to C$1.3244 Canadian Securities Other data releases showed that foreign investment in Canadian securities accelerated in November compared to the previous month, with the focus of their purchases in government bonds.

5e7c290844837e62c7ac210d	Australian Dollar, Stocks Brace for Multi-Million US Jobless Claims	The coronavirus’ terrible spread has battered risk sensitive assets like commodity currencies and equity this year. Massive programs of government stimulus brought prices back from the dead despite the unstoppable drip-feed of economic data practically guaranteeing global recession, but Thursday’s US labor market numbers seem likely to pose an insurmountable hurdle. Timely Purchasing Managers Index releases from around the world have already jolted markets with the scale of contraction. However, employment data are so crucial to everything else economic, from consumer spending through to monetary policy predictions, that it’s in these releases that fears tend to really crystalize in the markets. 1230GMT will bring official statistics on the numbers making initial claims for unemployment-related benefits in the week to March 21. The average expectation was that coronavirus shutdowns will see the claimant count soar to 1,500,000, from 281,000 in the previous week. However, California Governor Gavin Newsom told reporters on Wednesday that a million in his state alone had already applied for benefits this month. Economists at RBC Capital Markets tip a range of between five and ten million for new nationwide claims, according to a Reuters report. Obviously this would represent a catastrophic economic hit and, whatever the White House may wish for when it comes to an early restart for the economy, likely an enduring one. Moreover, stimulus programs can only really boost recovery, they can’t fire the starting gun on it. Only a crucial, sustained fall in coronavirus infection rates can do that, and no one knows how long that’s going to take. The big question when it comes to jobless claims data is now just how huge the hit is going to be. There can’t by now be much hope still priced in to markets as the number approach, but it’s hard to see an outturn in multiple millions being taken on the chin. The Australian Dollar is perhaps the classic, widely traded and growth-correlated asset and has accordingly already suffered terribly from the coronavirus’ spread. Against the haven US Dollar the Aussie has already shed 40% this year, a big hit even by the standards of other growth bets such as equity and energy. The past week or so has seen a modest bounce, as those stimulus programs were unveiled around the world. However, that bonce appears to have faded. Confirmation that multi-million new claimants were added to the roster last week could well see last week’s seventeen-year lows back in play very easily.

5e81b5e9c496d2354de73014	Risk appetite increases on trade war breakthrough hope	April 1-6, 2019 Equities are rallying and sovereign bond prices have been falling in week one of Q2. Investor optimism has been supported by stronger China PMI data and on the news that China and the U.S maybe on the cusp of a trade deal. It’s believed that most issues have been resolved between the world’s two largest economies. President Trump is expected to meet the trade delegations Thursday. Will he be able to announce a summit soon? Earnings season begins next Friday (April 12) with JP Morgan kicking things off. The market has already priced in a poor first quarter, with earnings on S&P 500 stocks seen declining by low-single digits. Central banks The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) left the cash rate target unchanged at +1.50% this week as expected. Policy makers omitted its prior comment noting “central scenario was still for the Australian economy to grow by around +3.0% in 2019.” But instead, inserted “to set policy to support sustainable growth and achieve the inflation target over time.” The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut its key policy rate by -25 bps to +6%. The central bank said since its last meeting in February, “global economic activity has been losing pace,” both in the U.S. and developed markets and emerging markets. The “domestic economy is facing headwinds, especially on the global front. The need is to strengthen domestic growth impulses by spurring private investment which has remained sluggish,” the bank said in a statement. Hence the necessity to cut key rates to aid the sluggish economy ahead of the upcoming elections. In Europe, the ECB policymakers debated the risk that ultra-low interest rates pose to banks. The effects of persistently low rates could depress banks’ interest margins and profitability, with negative effects on banks intermediation and financial stability in the longer run. Brexit and more Brexit U.K PM Theresa May announced a cross-party approach to break the impasse in parliament over Brexit. The PM has indicated she would look for Labour support for a new Brexit deal. However, there is no guarantee that Labour and the PM would agree terms on the Brexit path, nevertheless, the fact that she is willing to cross the floor is a clear shift in her party’s stance towards a ‘softer’ Brexit. PM May still insists that her withdrawal agreement – which was voted down last week – would remain part of the deal. The U.K requires an extension and PM May has said she wanted the extension to be “as short as possible” – before 22 May so the UK does not have to take part in European elections. The UK has until 12 April to propose a plan – which must be accepted by the EU – or it will leave without a deal. However, if the UK can approve the withdrawal agreement with a viable majority before next week’s summit, the EU will agree to a short extension up to May 22. On Wednesday, U.K lawmakers passed a vote by a majority of one to block a potentially destructive no-deal Brexit. This means that if a stalemate on exiting the E.U persists until the April 12 deadline; the PM will be forced to ask the EU for a long extension to the process. Data this week showed that Brexit worries has caused the dominant services sector to contract for the first time in nearly three-years, in fact, since the Brexit referendum. On the Economic Calendar, no releases are scheduled for this weekend. **DST – clocks go forward in Australia and New Zealand on the weekend Market concerns: Next week: GBP GDP & manufacturing product, ECB monetary policy statement, USD CPI & FOMC meeting minutes (Apr 10).

5e5d08e7bd5d9d5ac07275f1	Crude Oil Price Outlook Hinges on OPEC Meeting	The price of oil struggles to retain the rebound from the monthly low ($49.31) as the coronavirus poses a threat to the global supply chain, but efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) may keep crude prices afloat if the group takes additional steps to rebalance the energy market. The price of oil consolidates ahead of the OPEC meeting starting on March 5 as China, one of the largest consumers of crude, struggles to contain COVID-19, with the outbreak dampening the outlook for global growth. In response, OPEC and its allies may show a greater commitment to the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ by extending the agreement beyond the March 31 deadline as the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) insists that the group should curb production “until the end of 2020.” However, it remains to be seen if OPEC and its allies will further reduce supply after slashing oil output by an additional 500K b/d in December, and a mere extension of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ may keep oil prices under pressure as the most recent Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) highlights that “oil demand growth in 2020 is revised down by 0.23 mb/d from the previous month’s assessment.” With that said, the ongoing commitment to the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ may continue to provide a floor for crude prices, but the OPEC meeting may do little to fuel a larger recovery in the price of oil if the group maintains the quotas from earlier this year.

5e5d08ca73d82f5acc8afc8e	Dax Drop To Be Short Lived?	The Dax has dropped over 1% across the morning session, slipping back from Wednesday’s all-time high, as renewed concerns surrounding the coronavirus outbreak sweep across global markets. Levels to watch: After surging to a record high in the previous session, the Dax is off by 1%. Yet despite the pullback, the chart remains bullish for the Dax, even if the fundamentals aren’t so supportive. The Dax trade above its 50, 100 and 200 sma on the 4-hour chart. Immediate support can be seen at today’s low of 13577, prior to Monday’s low of 13445. A meaningful break through this level could negate the current bullish trend. On the upside, yesterday’s high and the fresh all time high of 13758.	EUR
5e71aecb14c27a4858d5575d	Dollar wobbles as liquidity measures seem to ease funding squeeze	SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar held overnight gains against most major currencies on Wednesday, after U.S. yields jumped and as deepening fear around the coronavirus drove a scramble for greenback. The pound and safe-haven yen made the best efforts at recovery, but only managed to recoup fractions of their losses. The yen was last up 0.3% at 107.37 per dollar, the pound up 0.5% at $1.2108 and the euro was steady at $1.1000. Commodity-sensitive currencies, like the Aussie and kiwi, were trampled below $0.60 in the stampede. All are well below where they were a week ago as investors sell just about everything for dollars and businesses seek to draw down loans and hoard cash to ride out the crisis. “It all stems from a shortage of US dollars,” said Gunter Seeger, senior vice president in investment-grade fixed income at New York asset manager PineBridge Investments. Dislocation in the U.S. bond market, where the yield on government debt has gyrated wildly for the past week, illustrates the desperation for cash, he said, even as the U.S. Federal Reserve pumps huge amounts of liquidity into the system. “People are very, very nervous,” Seeger said. “Everyone’s nervous about the virus, about oil prices, about their job, about everything.” Meanwhile the coronavirus only spreads, as country after country adopts draconian social restrictions and a war-footing mentality to try and contain the outbreak. The global death toll is above 7,800, the number of cases is approaching 200,000 and the economic fallout of what is in effect a global lockdown is spiralling. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasuries jumped 34 basis points higher overnight, the largest single-day rise since 2004 - further illustrating how massive selling is testing liquidity in even the deepest and broadest markets. The higher yield also adds yet more attraction to owning dollars, amid growing signs of tight supply - especially abroad. Cross-currency basis swap spreads, which show the cost of borrowing dollars abroad, hit their widest in years. Three-month euro/dollar cross-currency basis swap spreads rose as high as 120 basis points - its widest since late 2011 - before falling back to 39 basis points. Spreads for the Aussie and yen also widened dramatically. Risk currencies were also pounded with the mood, and nursed deep losses on Wednesday. The Australian dollar has made its first trip under 60 cents since 2003 and last sat at $0.5998, while the kiwi was at $0.5955. The Australian dollar has lost nearly 15% against the greenback this year. “In the context of the highly elevated levels of risk aversion and depths to which commodity prices have fallen...we said last week that both Antipodean currencies were on borrowed time above 0.60,” said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB.

Once the pair broke the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern last week, if was off to the races. Price has traded from 1.1094 down to today’s lows near 1.0834, which hasn’t been seen since May 2017. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Since election day on December 13th, 2019, GBP/USD has been trading in a symmetrical triangle. Price hadn’t done too much until last week when it tried to break lower from near the apex of the triangle, only to have that be a false breakdown and trade back into the apex today. Prime Minister Boris Johnson replaced Finance Minister Sajid David with Rishi Sunak, who traders believe will be more likely to induce more fiscal stimulus into the economy. This caused GBP/USD to go bid. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com With today’s price action in the Euro (lower) and Pound (higher), it seems logical that the next pair one would look at would be EUR/GBP, which is down almost 1% on the day. Technically, the pair has been trading nicely since August 2019, completing a flag pattern (blue) and almost reaching target (close enough for horseshoes) of a pennant pattern (orange). EUR/GBP reached a low of .8275 on UK election day, which was the low of the year for the pair. Price then bounced. However, with the Euro lower and the Pound stronger today, price is nearing the election lows once again. Price is currently trading near .8305. The first support for EUR/GBP is the .8275 level. Below that is the 127.2% Fibonacci extension level from the lows of May 8th, 2019 to the highs on August 12th, 2019 which is .8248. And although the previous mentioned pennant was almost reached, it once again is on our radar near .8165. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Below that, we have to zoom out to a weekly chart as EUR/GBP would be trading at 2016 levels. There is horizontal support and the 50% retracement level from the July 2015 lows to the summer 2019 highs, near .8115. Although that level is 200 pips lower, if price does reach it, there are likely to be strong buyers with ahead of that level with stops building below it. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com First resistance isn’t until near .8390, however notice on the 240-minute chart how the RSI in below 20, in extremely oversold territory. Price may bounce for the RSI to unwind. Above there, the next level of resistance is near .8435. The ultimate resistance though isn’t until the 2020 highs near .8595. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Although EUR/GBP appears to be heading lower, the short-term RSI allows for the opportunity to bounce first. However, given that EUR/USD has closed near the lows of the day today (again), we can expect sellers to be looking for any bounce to take advantage and push price lower.	GBP
5e603d11da28021d44827740	Chinese stocks lead gains as IMF announces $50 billion package to fight coronavirus	Stocks in Asia Pacific rose on Thursday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared more than 1,000 points overnight stateside. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also announced a $50 billion aid package on Wednesday to combat the impact of the coronavirus. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told CNBC the money is available “immediately” and is for low-income and emerging market countries. Stocks in mainland China were among the biggest gainers on the day, with the Shanghai composite up 1.99% to about 3,071.68 while the Shenzhen component added 1.9% to 11,711.37. The Shenzhen composite also gained 1.777% to approximately 1,929.44. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index advanced 1.95%, as of its final hour of trading, with shares of life insurer AIA soaring almost 3%. Shares in Australia also rose as the S&P/ASX 200 jumped 1.11% to close at 6,395.70, with shares of CSL surging 3.51%. Australia’s January trade data released Thursday came in above expectations. The balance on goods and services came in at a surplus of $5.21 billion Australian dollars (approx. $3.445 billion) on a seasonally adjusted basis, above expectations of a surplus of $4.8 billion Australian dollars in a Reuters poll. Meanwhile, the country warned on Thursday that the coronavirus crisis will deduct at least half a percentage point from growth in the current quarter, according to Reuters. Australia reported its second death from the disease, and a first from a local transmission. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 closed 1.09% higher at 21,329.12 while the Topix index also gained 0.88% to end its trading day at 1,515.71. South Korea’s Kospi closed 1.26% higher at 2,085.26 as shares of Celltrion soared 4.3%. Overall, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index was 1.26% higher. Investors continued to monitor for developments on the coronavirus outbreak that has now spread worldwide, with more than 90,000 confirmed cases globally. The IMF’s Georgieva told CNBC on Wednesday that the organization would like to see the money from its aid package used first to bolster health care systems and then for targeted fiscal stimulus programs and to boost liquidity. The moves by the IMF came amid a series of rate cuts from central banks this week, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia. “We’re keeping our portfolios reasonably balanced, there’s plenty of uncertainty still out there as we see ... coronavirus cases increase overseas,” Ed Brooke, senior investment advisor at Escala Partners, told CNBC’s “Capital Connection” on Thursday. “What’s becoming a little bit more known now is that we are going to see a central bank response and also a government response in fiscal policy,” Brooke said. “That’s helping cushion markets at the moment.” Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow skyrocketed 1,173.45 points higher to close at 27,090.86 — its second-highest point gain ever, and the second time in three days that the 30-stock average swung 1,000 points or higher. The S&P 500 jumped 4.2% to finish at 3,130.12, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 3.8% to close at 9,018.09. The strong rally on Wednesday lifted the three major averages stateside out of correction territory, leaving them now less than 10% down from their 52-week highs. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was last at 97.339 after seeing an earlier low of 97.326. The Japanese yen changed hands at 107.22 per dollar after seeing lows above 108 earlier in the trading week. The Australian dollar was at $0.6627 after its rise from levels below $0.655 this week. Oil prices rose in the afternoon of Asian trading hours, with international benchmark Brent crude futures adding 0.9% to $51.59 per barrel. U.S. crude futures also gained 0.75% to $47.13 per barrel. — CNBC’s Fred Imbert contributed to this report.	EQUITY
5e94ab4025bc1963a2d1b9b0	WTI Coiling After OPEC+ Production Cut Agreement	Mirroring the likely path of a post-COVID-19 economic recovery, traders are gradually filtering back to their desks after a long holiday weekend. With volumes running far lower than usual and many major markets still closed, we’re cautious about reading too much into current prices, but the latest developments in the oil market cannot be ignored. After a week-long marathon of negotiations, the world’s top oil producers agreed to a deal to cut global oil production by 9.7M bpd, about 10% of total output. The bulk of the promised cuts fittingly fall to Saudi Arabia and Russia, who kicked off the current oversupply issues by failing to reach an agreement back in early March. When it comes to the oil market though, even these production cuts will not bring supply and demand into balance. The mass disruption from the COVID-19 outbreak has absolutely decimated demand (GasBuddy reported that demand for petrol has fallen by -55% from early February levels), and these cuts, especially relative to the inflation production figures over the last month, will not bring the market back into balance unless we see a dramatic “V-shaped” economic recovery in the coming weeks. That said, the Saudi Oil Minister recently announced that the Kingdom is prepared to cut production further in June if necessary, so at least oil bulls can take solace in the fact that producers are taking the situation seriously. Even US President Trump hinted this morning that additional production cuts could be on the way. Turning our attention to the hourly chart, prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil, the American standard blend, are trading smack dab in the middle of the 4-week range between support at 20.00 and resistance up near 28.50: Source: TradingView, GAIN Capital As we go to press, WTI is forming a short-term symmetrical triangle pattern. For the uninitiated, or the uninitiated, this pattern is analogous to a person compressing a coiled spring: as the range continues to contract, energy builds up within the spring. When one of the pressure points is eventually removed, the spring will explode in that direction. It’s notoriously difficult to predict the direction of the breakout in advance, so short-term traders may want to wait for the breakout and trade in the same direction once its confirmed. For example, a downside breakout could open the door for a drop toward range support in the 20.00-21.00 zone, whereas a bullish break could set the stage for a continuation toward the 27.00 area, where we’ve seen resistance form earlier this month.

5e8cc7a5a7538831ac6f4609	Stocks gain but trade off the highs as coronavirus spread appears to slow, more stimulus mulled	U.S stocks rose Tuesday afternoon, but were off the session highs, as the market extended a rally to a second session on growing signs that the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic may be leveling off in parts of the world. Markets also were encouraged by reports of further planned U.S. measures to help dampen the recessionary impact of shutdowns and business closures intended to limit the epidemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.74% rose 396 points, or 1.8%, to reach 23,079, the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.42% gained 41 points, or 1.5%, at 2,704, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.84% advanced 72 points, or 0.9%, to reach 7,984. At session highs early Tuesday, the Dow had gained 937.25 points, or 4.1%, the S&P 500 rose 93.21 points, or 3.5%, and the Nasdaq gained 233.20 points, or 2.9%. As of Tuesday afternoon, all three benchmarks had recovered more than 20% from their 52-week low on March 23. Eagerness to buy beaten-down stocks took hold for a second straight session on Wall Street, as investors focused on signs of a slowdown in new daily deaths and infections from COVID-19, the deadly disease that was first identified in Wuhan, China in December. Italy reported the lowest number of new coronavirus infections in nearly three weeks, after China reported no new deaths, though deaths in Spain rose after declining for four consecutive days. “It appears we’re hitting the worst of this wave of the coronavirus,” Mike Dowdall, investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management told MarketWatch. “It’s too early to call the all-clear in the U.S., but the most dire scenarios we were looking at a week or two ago appear to be avoided for now.” Reports also suggested that U.S. lawmakers are hashing out a so-called Phase 4 relief package for next month that could be worth more than $1 trillion, to help prop up the economy and assist workers and small companies, according to Bloomberg. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida also said Tuesday that a bipartisan effort for additional coronavirus aid for small businesses could be put to a vote Thursday, potentially expanding aid to employers and their workers during the shutdown. These factors have offered some guarded optimism to bullish investors still wrestling with fallout from the pandemic, which has pushed domestic and international economies into recession. “We certainly are not complaining that the market is rebounding,” said Adam Phillips, director of portfolio strategy at EP Wealth Advisors in Los Angeles, but he cautioned that questions linger as to if the rally can be sustained. “We are seeing progress, but the virus is not under control yet,” he told MarketWatch. “The economy data still remains at the mercy of the virus.” Globally, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 rose to more than 1.38 million, spreading across more than 100 countries, while deaths topped 78,000, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. There are more than 370,500 confirmed cases in the U.S. and more than 11,000 deaths, with New York reporting 731 dead, its highest daily rate yet. Japan also declared a state of emergency, as expected, in seven of its prefectures to help direct resources to slowing the spread of the illness. In U.S. economic news, the NFIB survey, a monthly snapshot of small businesses, found that the optimism index fell in March to 96.4, an 8.1-point decline and the largest monthly decline in the survey’s history. The survey data come just a week after the U.S. government’s rolled out a coronavirus-rescue package, known as the CARES Act, which initially includes $350 billion in forgivable loans for small businesses. In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.738% rose about 9 basis points to 0.77%. Crude oil prices were moving lower, with the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery CLK20, -7.51% trading 3.6% lower at $25.14 a barrel. In precious metals, the price of an ounce of gold for June delivery GCM20, -0.76% fell $10.20, or 0.6%, to settle at $1,683.70 an ounce. The U.S. dollar fell 0.7% relative to a basket of trading peers, according to the ICE U.S. Dollar DXY, -0.77% In Europe, stocks finished trading higher, with the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, +1.88% gaining 1.9%, its second day in a row of gains. In Asia overnight, stocks closed significantly higher. The China CSI 300 000300, +2.28% rose 2.3%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index HSI, +2.12% added 2.1% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 NIK, +2.01% rose 2%.

5e7a1b7263edf762027e13a8	EUR/USD Breaks Near-Term Bearish Channel, Bulls Eye 1.10 Next?	Global markets are in the midst of a classic “Turnaround Tuesday” as we go to press, with US index futures trading near “limit up” levels, commodities rallying, and bonds trading lower across the globe. With little in the way of immediate progress on a “big bazooka” US fiscal package, the UK going on lockdown yesterday evening, and coronavirus cases continuing to rise in Europe and the U.S., there’s little on the fundamental front to support the bullish reversal yet. While we’ve repeatedly argued that markets will reverse when fundamental data is still ugly (i.e. when traders least expect it), we’re still skeptical that today’s moves will mark a long-term bottom, though we’re always willing to be proven wrong! Focusing in on the world’s most widely-traded currency pair, there is nonetheless potential for a bigger rally in EUR/USD after an 800-pip shellacking in the past two weeks alone. The mad scramble to buy the U.S. dollar at any costs is taking an apparent breather, helped along by crisis-era measures from the Federal Reserve to open swap lines with other central banks and purchase unlimited amounts of treasuries and MBS “to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy.” Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, mainland Europe has seen its first release of major post-coronavirus pandemic data from the timely PMI surveys, and the news was ugly, though perhaps not as bad as some analysts had feared. On a headline basis, the manufacturing survey printed at 44.8 for the eurozone, above expectations of a 40.1 reading, though the more important service sector survey came in at just 28.4, well below the 40.0 reading anticipated by traders and economists. The euro’s performance as a top 3 major currency so far today underscores that in this environment, even ugly data can support a market if its better than traders’ low expectations. Technically speaking, EUR/USD appears to be rallying out of its two-week bearish channel, though it has yet to reach any of the significant retracements of the mid-March collapse. Given the strong selling pressure of late, bulls may want to consider taking profits quickly while bears will be looking for opportunities to re-enter short positions. Logical levels to watch this week include 1.0960 (the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the mid-month swoon), 1.1000 (key psychological resistance) and 1.1060 (the 50% retracement): Original Post	USD
5e5e291418538f1034fdffa2	U.S. dollar falls as expectations of a Fed rate cut rise	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar index weakened on Tuesday as expectations grew that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates this year to relieve pressure on the economy caused by China’s coronavirus outbreak. The dollar rose last week to its highest level in years as the virus spread further around the world, with investors regarding all U.S. assets as safe havens. But the index has fallen this week as other safe havens have risen because money managers now think the Fed may be more inclined to cut rates since it has the most room to do so. Rate cuts are inflationary, lowering the value of the dollar. Expectations that the Fed will cut rates at least 25 basis points at its June meeting were at 78.3% on Tuesday, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. The same tool shows a 4.1% chance that rates will be in the current 150-175 basis-point range in December, down from 28.6% a month ago. “The potential for the economic fallout from the virus to wash up on U.S. shores has cooled the dollar’s rally to three-year peaks by knocking Treasury yields to multi-year lows and raising expectations for the Federal Reserve to deliver more interest rate cuts to keep the record long expansion intact,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions. Against a basket of six other currencies the dollar slipped 0.401% to 98.939, after reaching a three-year high of close to 100 last week. The index fell in step with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield, which hit an all-time low, driven by safe-haven demand. That flight to safety also saw U.S. stock indexes fall, with Wall Street’s three major indexes down almost 2% on Tuesday. [US/] [.N] The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday alerted Americans to begin preparing for the spread of coronavirus in the United States after the flu-like virus surfaced in several more countries. Versus the euro, the dollar was modestly weaker, last down 0.28% at $1.088. Market gauges of implied volatility in euro/dollar eased on Tuesday after rising to their highest level since October on Monday. The yen was 0.61% stronger at 110.04 per dollar. China’s yuan was last up 0.11% at 7.028 per U.S. dollar in the offshore market, after rising to a five-day high earlier in the session.

5e689f6ce5925b7c9d900724	GBP/USD Resilient Post Rate Cut, Budget Next	GBP/USD is clawing back losses after the BoE made an emergency 50 basis point rate cut early on Wednesday, in an unscheduled move. This takes the interest rate from 0.75% to 0.25%, ahead of the Chancellor’s arguably more important budget due later in the day. Budget up next UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s Budget is expected to be dominated by money for the NHS and to businesses to help them survive over what is expected to be a very difficult few months. The Chancellor is expected to be generous in his fight to limit the economic impact that coronavirus will have on the UK economy. Investors will be looking for strong short-term measures and spending plans that will prevent a very hard but temporary hit on the economy becoming something far more deeply entrenched and longer term. Should the markets consider than Chancellor Rishi Sunak has not gone far enough with spending to support the economy, the pound could fall. GBP/USD levels to watch GBP/USD dived an initial 100 points hitting a weekly low on the news of the cut, in a knee jerk reaction. However, the pair is clawing back those losses and is pushing back into positive territory at $1.29. Whilst GBP/USD traded above the descending trend line in the previous session, it hasn’t managed to remain above it. A sustained move above $1.2970 could negate the current bearish trend. Immediate support can be seen at $1.2828 (today’s low) prior to $1.2725 (low 28th Feb) and $1.2705 (200 sma). Resistance can be seen at $1.2970 (trend line) ahead of $1.3130 (yesterday’s high) and $1.32 (Monday’s high).	GBP
5e81b610c496d2354de73040	King Dollar	Monday February 11: Five things the markets are talking about Equities are small better bid in the euro session following a mixed session in Asia that sees a holiday shorten trading week in Japan. The ‘big’ dollar remains dominate for an eight consecutive session where again Sino-U.S trade talks and Brexit discussions top investors agendas. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will join U.S Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and trade representative Lighthizer in Beijing for high-level trade talks this week. In the U.K, PM Theresa May is seeking more time to renegotiate Brexit talks, while stateside, another U.S government shutdown over funding remains very much on the agenda. Crude oil and gold are a tad softer on a stronger greenback whilst sovereign yields are little changed. On tap: Mid-week, eurozone data this week (Feb 13 & 14) will be watched for any recessionary clues. On Tuesday (Feb 12) RBNZ will hold its first meeting of the year and ‘dovish’ talk will be sought, while Sweden’s Riksbank is expected to keep interest rates on hold Wednesday (Feb 13). Elsewhere, GBP inflation, CAD trade balance, USD GDP, inflation & retail sales, USD PPI (Feb 14), GBP & USD retail sales (Feb 15). 1. Stocks mixed results Note: Japan was closed for a national holiday. Down-under, Aussie stocks retreated overnight, as a rally in resource stocks was offset by declines in financials and healthcare equities. The S&P/ASX 200 index closed down -0.2%, while in S. Korea, the Kospi index closed +0.17% higher. In China, regional bourses played catch-up after a week-long Lunar New Year holiday break. Gains came as the commerce ministry indicated that retail earnings during holiday season would increase by +8.5% y/y, and this despite domestic growth being under pressure. At the close, China’s blue-chip index rallied +1.6% while Shanghai’s composite climbed +1.2%. In Hong Kong, at the close of trade, the Hang Seng index was up +0.7%, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises index gained +0.6%. In Europe, regional bourses trade higher across the board after a flat close stateside on Friday and a mixed session in Asia. U.S stocks are set to open in the ‘black’ (+0.36%). Indices: Stoxx600 +0.94% at 361.52, FTSE +0.94% at 7,140.25, DAX +0.97% at 11,012.55, CAC-40 +1.06% at 5,014.06, IBEX-35 +1.07% at 8,952.00, FTSE MIB +1.47% at 19,635.50, SMI +0.86% at 9,078.00, S&P 500 Futures +0.36% 2. Oil prices lower on higher U.S rig count, gold unchanged Oil prices are starting the week under pressure as data Friday showed that drilling activity in the U.S picked up and a refinery fire stateside (in Illinois on Sunday) has resulted in the shutdown of a large crude distillation unit. Also, global growth worries are also helping to curb fuel demand. Brent crude oil futures are down -27c, or -0.4%, at +$61.83 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures are at +$52.17 per barrel, down -55c, or -1% from Friday’s close. In the U.S, Baker Hughes data Friday showed that energy firms last week increased the number of oil rigs operating for the second time in three weeks. Companies added seven oil rigs in the week to Feb. 8, bringing the total count to 854 – this would suggest an increased rise in U.S crude production. And another factor weighing on oil prices this month has been a stronger U.S dollar. Ahead of the U.S open, gold prices are little changed, supported mostly by uncertainties around the Sino-U.S trade war and concerns of slowing global economic growth, while a strong U.S dollar weighs on the ‘yellow’ metal. Spot gold is steady at +$1,308 per ounce, while U.S gold futures are also firm at +$1,312 per ounce. 3. Sovereign yields remain low Safe-haven government bonds have benefited the most on growing investor anxiety over the global outlook, with German and Japanese debt yields falling to their lowest in over two-years. Germany’s 10-year Bund yield is just +8 bps away from “zero” percent. Analysts note that its “now in territory that reflects dire concern about economic conditions.” The yield fell as low as +0.77% on Friday, its lowest since October 2016, reflecting dire concern in bond markets about economic conditions. Despite weaker eurozone growth data and inflation the prospect of another U.S government shutdown and continuing Brexit discussions are also weighing on investors risk appetite. Elsewhere, the yield on U.S 10-year Treasuries has backed up +1 bps to +2.64%, the first advance in a week, while in Italy the 10-year BTP yield has gained +2 bps to +2.983%, hitting the highest in two-months with its fifth consecutive advance. 4. King dollar The EUR (-0.17% at €1.1300) starts the week a tad softer and is currently testing the lower end of its €1.1300-€1.1500 trading range. With increasing talk of a slowdown in Europe the markets focus will be on German data on Feb 14 – just how bad are things in the eurozone’s biggest economy? GBP/USD is softer by -0.3% at £1.2897 with the continued Brexit issues remaining ‘front and center.’ The market expects PM Theresa May to request more time before she puts her deal to a fresh vote in Parliament while she has more talks with the E.U. The pound has also come under pressure from this morning’s weaker U.K data – Q3 preliminary GDP, Dec. production data and Dec. trade balances all missing expectations. Note: If there was no fresh meaningful vote by February 27th then PM would allow Parliament to vote on alternatives. USD/JPY trades above the psychological ¥110 level at ¥110.20 as the market begins the week with a more optimistic outlook of the upcoming US-China trade talks. Note: CHF recreated a “mini-flash” crash at the start of Asian session overnight, supported mostly by the Japan holiday causing an illiquid trading session. 5. U.K economy slowed in 2018 Data this morning showed that the U.K economy slowed in 2018 as businesses slashed investment because of the growing uncertainty about the U.K’s exit from the E.U. Note: The BoE has warned that the economy could fall into recession due to a disorderly exit. The ONS said the U.K.’s GDP was +1.4% higher in 2018 than in 2017, the weakest expansion in seven-years. They noted that the economy slowed more sharply in Q4, with GDP rising at an annualized pace of +0.7%, down from +2.5% in Q3. In December alone, GDP fell by -0.4% from November.

5e6f868d048bed55f617c3b8	Central Banks Take Coordinated Action	As central banks around the world have acted to stem the economic fallout from the global threat of the coronavirus, one of the most volatile currency pairs has been the USD/JPY. As you may be aware the US Federal Reserve has taken unprecedented emergency measures by cutting interest rates to a 0-25% range and has announced a new $700B QE program. The BoJ has taken measures of their own by doubling its ETF target to JPY 12 trillion! In addition, BoJ Governor Kuroda indicated that they will increase the amount of corporate bonds they will be buying. They have also introduced a new zero rate loan facility. Some of these moves appear to be taken as a sign of desperation central bank, as stock markets around the world are tumbling and US stocks open limit down. As a result, USD/JPY has been moving lower in a flight to safety move. On Friday, the pair reached as high as 108.50. However, on the open the pair gapped lower with stocks and has traded as low as 105.15. On a daily timeframe, we can see that after spiking through the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the February 20th highs to the March 9th lows near 108.04, price has moved 300 pips lower today into a band of support between 105.50 and 105.00. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com On a 240-minute timeframe, we can see that the upward move has created a channel and price is currently threatening to break lower. However, this is NOT a flag formation as price has retraced too much off the lows. In order to be considered a flag formation, price should not retrace more than 50% of the move. If price does break lower from here, the next support isn’t down until 103. Resistance is up at the highs of the day near 107.50, then Friday’s highs near 108.50. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com The range on the day for USD/JPY is already over 225 pips and the pair is down -2.25% (that is a large move in percentage terms for a currency pair). However, the RSI on both the daily and the 240-minute chart is in neutral territory. Therefore, price still has room to run to the downside. This will be an interesting pair to watch going forward as we have seen over the last few days that DXY has also become a flight to safety. If traders feel that the US Dollar is a “safer” currency than JPY, the pair could reverse and trade higher, even if stocks continue lower! Trade safe!	JPY
5e7a7559e21e981e821cbb18	Dollar pares losses as investors wait on stimulus bill	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gave up most of its early losses on Tuesday as investors waited on a Senate stimulus bill meant to blunt the economic impact of the spreading coronavirus, and after U.S. President Donald Trump pressed his case for a re-opening of the U.S. economy by mid-April. Senior Democrats and Republicans said on Tuesday they were close to a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus package, raising hopes that the divided U.S. Congress could soon act to try to limit the pandemic’s economic fallout. There is mounting frustration among some politicians that businesses are closing to stop the spread of the virus, which is leading analysts to predict the nation will see the worst recession since the Great Depression. At the same time, many investors think markets and the economy will not be able to stabilise until the worst of the virus spread has passed. “While we think that most currencies will eventually regain much of the ground that they have recently lost to the U.S. dollar, we don’t expect that process to start until the pandemic has clearly passed its worst,” Oliver Allen, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said in a report. Against a basket of its rivals, the dollar fell 0.17% to 101.95. It fell as low as 101.04 on Tuesday and is down from a more than three-year high of 102.99 on Friday. Trump has said he would like the U.S. economy to reopen by Easter, saying that Americans could continue practicing social-distancing measures, which health experts say are crucial to prevent infection, while also returning to work. But medical experts and officials on both sides of the U.S. political spectrum say it is critical to stop the spread of the virus, whatever the economic cost. New steps taken by the Federal Reserve on Monday to boost liquidity across debt markets and backstop lending are seen as helping market conditions. “The Fed’s measures are unprecedented, and they have been extremely proactive in preventing this external shock from morphing into a wider funding crisis,” said Vasileios Gkionakis, head of FX strategy at Lombard Odier. The U.S. central bank announced various programs, including purchases of corporate bonds, guarantees for direct loans to companies and a plan to get credit to small and medium-sized business. Against the dollar, the euro was up 0.47% at $1.0771. Some more relief was also evident in dollar funding markets, with measures of short-term funding indicators such as euro-dollar FX swaps for three-month maturities stabilizing around 6 basis points after blowing out to more than 100 bps last week. The British pound rose 1.67% to $1.1741, up from a 35-year low of $1.1413 set last week. The Australian dollar gained 1.75% to $0.5929, extending its recovery from a 17-year low of $0.5510 last week.

5e6199b0d393802eb7b6d414	Yen Soars, USD/JPY and Dow Jones Sink. Investors Seek Shelter in Bonds	The anti-risk Japanese Yen and similarly-behaving Swiss Franc were some of the best-performing major currencies on Thursday as a selloff in global stocks picked up pace again. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed -3.58%, -3.39% and -3.58% to the downside respectively. There were a couple of fundamental developments that could help to explain today’s dismal performance in equities. Coronavirus fears were in focus as senators reported that the U.S. will miss on virus test rollout goals. This is as the U.K. reported its first death of the Wuhan virus. The selloff on Wall Street also picked up pace after a couple of Treasury auctions. Yields on 4-week and 8-week bills tumbled to 0.93% and 0.82% from 1.53% and 1.50% prior respectively. This likely spoke to investors prioritizing preserving capital, undermining stocks. The US Dollar continued being battered by tumbling bond yields, reflecting rising expectations of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Futures markets are fully pricing in 3 more reductions by the end of this year. That would bring the target range to 0.25% to 0.50%. Prospects of diminishing return in cash boosted anti-fiat gold prices as XAU/USD continued setting new highs for 2020. The “pro-risk” AUD and NZD fell. A relatively quiet economic docket during Friday’s Asia Pacific trading session places the focus for currencies on risk trends. In early hours, reports crossed the wires from Maryland which reported its first 3 cases of COVID-19. Regional equities such as the Nikkei 225 and ASX 200 may follow Wall Street lower. That may bode well for the Japanese Yen at the expense of the Australian Dollar and New Zealand Dollar. USD/JPY extended its selloff from 2019 highs after taking out rising support from August – as expected. Prices have now closed under October lows, exposing last year’s trough at 104.45. From here, a further downside close may solidify the pair’s downward trajectory. This is as falling resistance from February is maintaining the downtrend.

5e5d08eebd5d9d5ac07275f9	Canadian Dollar Price Outlook: USD/CAD Bounces on Risk Aversion	USD/CAD rallied to start the week, continuing its move off confluent support around the 1.32 level. While the technical moat may have provided assistance in staving off deeper declines last week, volatility elsewhere suggests much of Monday’s move may be attributable to coronavirus concerns. To that end, confirmed cases in the United States and Canada are relatively low, but the price of crude oil – a key export of Canada – has been battered which may have played a role in the Canadian Dollar’s decline. A broader flight to safety, via the US Dollar, is another likely culprit. Either way, IG Client Sentiment Data reveals traders are overwhelmingly net-short which may suggest further gains are in store. Should bullish price action continue, USD/CAD may look to target longstanding resistance overhead, which currently resides around the 1.3345 level. If the driving forces behind USD/CAD change and bears attempt another move lower, the pair will still enjoy a bounty of support around the 1.32 level. If volatility cools and calmer price action prevails, the pair could look to bounce between the two longstanding levels of support and resistance as it works sideways in a larger range.

5e88bdc3eaca02022d7b6165	3 S&P sectors climbed this week — here are the stocks that rose and fell the most	Stocks ended the week with relatively moderate declines, considering the “new normal” of high volatility on most days of the coronavirus crisis. The week’s winners were mainly energy companies. • The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.68% fell 361 points, or 1.7%, on Friday to close at 21,052.53. The index is down 2.7% from a week ago, down 28.8% from its closing high on Feb. 12 and down 26.2% so far in 2020. (All figures in this article exclude dividends.) • The S&P 500 index SPX, -1.51% lost 1.5% Friday for a one-week decline of 2.1%. The benchmark index has now fallen 26.5% from its closing high on Feb. 19 and is down 23% so far in 2020. This year’s slump, of course, follows a 28.9% jump in 2019. Considering how quickly the COVID-19 pandemic led to 10 million in new unemployment claims in two weeks, you may be surprised that the S&P 500 is down only 13.4% from a year ago. • The Nadaq Composite Index COMP, -1.52% was down 1.5% on Friday for a one-week decline of 1.7%. The index is down 24.9% from its record close on Feb. 19 and down 17.8% so far in 2020. After President Trump called Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump said on Thursday via Twitter that he expected the countries to cut oil production by 10 million barrels a day. The president is trying to help U.S. shale oil producers — who have relatively high production costs — survive the lack of demand, which has been exacerbated by production increases by Saudi Arabia and Russia. Myra Saefong explained that the U.S. will have to cooperate in an OPEC+ production cut in order for it to be effective.

5e6b88f14510ae25770acfa3	Dollar surges versus Japanese yen as markets rally	LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rallied on Friday, gaining sharply versus the yen, as stock markets rebounded and investors welcomed signs that governments and policymakers were prepared to do more to tackle the economic shock of the coronavirus. The greenback extended gains against several currencies after a blowout in swap spreads on Thursday signalled that investors want dollars. While those spreads came in on Friday, the dollar held strong. Among the big gains was against the Japanese yen, up more than 2% to a weekly high at 107.17 yen on Friday. The euro nursed losses despite European Central Bank policymakers trying to reassure markets following a big selloff in European assets on Thursday after investors were underwhelmed by the bank’s stimulus measures. Norway’s central bank became the latest to cut rates on Friday in an attempt to limit the economic damage, sending the crown up around 2% against the U.S. dollar and the euro as investors welcomed the move to support the oil-dependent economy. Analysts at HSBC said the crown could rebound further if the Norwegian government repatriates some of its vast overseas assets. “Norway still has some monetary policy flexibility. But more importantly it has acres of fiscal room,” they said. The ECB on Thursday announced a stimulus package that provides loans to banks with rates as low as -0.75% and increases bond purchases, but it did not join its counterparts in the United States and Britain by cutting rates. ECB President Christine Lagarde aggravated a market selloff by saying it was not the central bank’s job to close the spread between the borrowing costs of various members, comments which she later tried to roll back. Opinion was divided on the ECB’s package, with analysts at Commerzbank arguing that its decision “not to fire all pointless Bazooka barrels” with a rate cut was a sensible choice and predicted the euro was likely to recover. “In times of crisis the ECB does not take extreme, EUR-negative measures. Let us give the market a little more time to get used to that,” they said. “Once it has done that it is likely to value the euro more highly, reflecting the fact that a safe haven currency is attractive to investors.” The euro traded down 0.3% at $1.1158, following a 0.7% decline on Thursday in the wake of the ECB decision. For the week, the common currency is on course for a 1% decline. The pound, dropped 0.5% to $1.2798. The greenback’s rebound this week reflects its role as the world’s most liquid currency that investors seek in times of stress. The Fed meets next week and many analysts now expect the central bank to chop its own target policy rate, quite possibly to zero, and give markets new guidance about how it plans to combat the economic fallout from the coronavirus. Cross-currency basis swap spreads for the yen and the pound fell on Friday after Thursday’s blow out. The Australian and New Zealand dollars bounced more than 1%. They were mauled on Thursday as investors shunned riskier currencies that are linked to the global commodities trade. The Swiss franc fell as investors dumped safe haven currencies.

5e81b5dcc496d2354de7300a	USD/CAD Canadian Dollar Lower as US dollar Gains Retail Sales Boost	The Canadian dollar fell 0.28 percent on Thursday. US economic data was the deciding factor as the dollar rose against the loonie despite crude prices heading higher. Canadian retail sales had strong gains but could not overcome their US counterpart. American retail sales exceeded expectations and boosted the dollar against the board. Oil prices softened the fall of the CAD as crude is still supported by supply disruptions as US sanctions on Iranian and Venezuelan exports remain and the military actions in Libya continue. OPEC+ efforts are the main factor in adding stability to prices, despite rising US production. The pivotal moment for crude prices will come when the group meets at the end of the current agreement term to discuss what are the next steps. Canada has extended the Trans Mountain oil pipeline decision to June 18. The pipeline has been beset by regulatory and ecological group pressures, but it promises to almost triple output from the oil sands into British Columbia. The US dollar is higher against most major pairs after retail sales in the United States exceeded expectations with a 1.6 percent gain. Solid data ahead of the Easter holiday gave the greenback the edge against other currencies. European data, in particular manufacturing PMIs keep dropping putting more pressure on the euro. The European Central Bank (ECB) has been dovish as growth in the Union is running out of traction. The USMCA was in the news again as the US International Trade Commission reported that the deal between the US, Mexico and Canada would boost growth in the US. The quasijudicial Federal agency is giving thumbs up for the trade agreement as it needs to be ratified by all three members. OIL – Oil Rises as Saudi Arabia Keeps Cutting Production Crude prices rose on Thursday. Brent gained 0.4 percent and WTI 0.27 percent despite a rebound in the US dollar. Better than expected retail sales in the US boosted the currency ahead of the Easter long weekend. Energy prices ended higher as Saudi Arabia continues to report drops in crude exports. The OPEC+ agreement to cut production has been led by example by the Kingdom now cutting 227,000 daily barrels in February. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) report showed a drawdown of 1.4 million barrels with gasoline and distillates also showing reductions. Supply concerns persists with US sanctions against Iran and Venezuela and the civil war in Libya, but the OPEC+ agreement has been the bigger factor. The deal to limit production has stabilized prices working against rising US production. Energy demand was given a positive signal as China grew 6.4 percent in the first quarter of 2019. The biggest obstacle for higher prices is the same factors that got them here in the first place. US sanctions against Iran and Venezuela could get tighter, but it could trigger an end to the OPEC+ deal. Russia and other major producers have hinted that they could ramp up production. US shale expectations point to more supply, so a repeat of 2014 when prices fell off a cliff could present itself if Saudi Arabia does not manage to convince major producers to keep the production cuts active. GOLD – Yellow Metal Flat with Safe Haven Appeal Diminishing Gold was flat on Thursday but is headed for a 1.4 percent weekly drop as investors sold safe havens looking for higher returns. Risk events have been pushed out to the medium term and with uncertainty easing gold is on the back foot. The rise of the dollar after positive economic news put more downward pressure on the metal, but while anxiety around geopolitical events has eased into the background, there was no closure with Brexit, US-China trade war and other events sure to pop back up again which is why gold could once again be used as a safe haven. Physical demand of gold has been on the rise with some central banks buying large quantities to diversify their reserves away from the US dollar. Retail investors have also taken opportunistic positions with current prices on the decline and the timing has worked out for Indian jewellers ahead of the Akshaya Tritiya festival. STOCKS – US Indicators Boost Markets Despite European Woes Global stocks were mostly in positive territory despite sell offs in specific sectors. The retail sales data point boosted the market as its injected confidence in the US. Earlier European data had cast doubts on economic growth going forward and put downward pressure on the euro. Geopolitical risk was less present this week with the Muller report failing to get a strong reaction from investors. Growth concerns remain as mixed data has been the norm but now with less pressure from risk events there will be more focus on fundamental data. This article is for general information purposes only.

5e6bdd8755c32d407e0cda68	Dollar surges vs yen as stock markets rally	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar surged on Friday, posting sharp gains against the safe-haven Japanese yen as stock markets recovered globally and investors cheered efforts by governments and policymakers to address the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. The greenback extended gains against several currencies after a blowout in swap spreads on Thursday signaled that investors want dollars. While those spreads came in on Friday, the dollar held strong. The dollar also benefited from a news report that U.S. President Donald Trump will declare a national emergency over the fast-spreading coronavirus on Friday, opening the door to more federal aid to combat the disease. But market participants said signs of dollar funding stress persist and policymakers probably need to do more. “Underlying concerns regarding the economic fallout from the coronavirus on credit markets broadly remain,” said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, at Scotiabank in Toronto. “It may be tempting to look for signs of a low in global stocks but with the underlying issue - the coronavirus - still unchecked, we think that is premature at this point,” he added. He noted that the cost of raising U.S. dollar funds in the cross-currency euro swap market has widened again on Friday after narrowing the day before on the Federal Reserve’s announcement to inject more liquidity into the banking system. Wider spreads in the cross currency basis swap market suggested increased signs of U.S. dollar shortage for corporates seeking funding. In afternoon trading, the dollar gained 2.9% against the yen to 107.66 JPY=EBS. Wells Fargo said it had further upgraded its forecast for the yen against the dollar as the risk of financial turmoil remains, saying that the greenback will fall below 100 yen. “The rate cuts and other policy actions from global central banks have done little to quell market panic. That may be due to the fact that fiscal policymakers have generally been slow to act,” said Wells Fargo in a research note. The dollar also rallied versus another safe haven, the Swiss franc, rising 1.1% to 0.9543 franc. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar rose 1.2% to 98.362 =USD. The euro nursed losses despite European Central Bank policymakers’ efforts to reassure markets. European assets sold off on Thursday after investors were underwhelmed by the bank’s stimulus measures. The euro was last down 0.9% at $1.1091 . The ECB on Thursday announced a stimulus package that provides loans to banks with rates as low as -0.75% and increases bond purchases, but it did not join its counterparts in the United States and Britain by cutting rates. The pound also plunged 2% against the dollar to $1.2302. The greenback’s rebound this week reflects its role as the world’s most liquid currency, which investors seek in times of stress.

5e5d07555040145532db642b	EUR/USD on the edge of multi-year lows, but may find its feet	How low can the euro go? The world’s most popular currency pair is trading close to the 2019 trough of 1.0879, and a break below this level opens the door to levels last seen in 2017. The main downside driver of euro/dollar has been economic divergence. The US economy enjoys solid growth – with Friday’s jobs report still underpinning the greenback – while the old continent is struggling. Monday’s Sentix Investor Confidence missed with 5.2 points, expressing lower expectations. The euro has also been suffering from political developments in Germany. Annegret Kramp Karrenbauer resigned from leading Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling CDU party and the grand coalition seems vulnerable. The coronavirus outbreak continues dominating headlines with the death toll topping 1,000. On the other hand, most of China is back to work after extended holidays and the number of new cases has fallen. Stock markets are on the rise and the safe-haven US dollar is edging lower. Nevertheless, EUR/USD’s uptick is minimal – a dead cat bounce. The common currency is exposing its weakness. Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, goes to Capitol Hill for his twice-annual testimony. The Fed has been stressing that current interest rates are appropriate, but bond markets foresee a rate cut in September. Powell will probably try to strike a balance between healthy economic growth at home and risks from the coronavirus. Some analysts expect him to leave the door open to fresh cuts, thus allowing the dollar to slide. Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank will also be testifying before lawmakers. Lagarde has completed 100 days in her position and she reportedly wants to conclude the bank’s strategic review in July and not by year-end. The former head of the International Monetary Fund’s comment on recent weak figures in the eurozone may weigh on the euro, but so far, she has been cautious. Overall, coronavirus headlines will compete with central bankers for influence on euro/dollar. The Relative Strength Index on the four-hour chart is well below 30 – indicating oversold conditions and an upcoming bounce. However, this rise may be shortlived as momentum remains to the downside and the pair continues trading below the 50, 100, and 200 Simple Moving Averages. Some support awaits at the daily trough of 1.0905, which is also the lowest since October. The next level is critical – 1.0879 was the 2019 low. Further down, prices seen back in 2017 await EUR/USD, and these include 1.0810 and 1.0790. Resistance is at 1.0925, which had a role in October, followed by 1.0940 which provided support earlier in February. Next, we find 1.0965 and 1.0985.	USD
5e5d08fbbd5d9d5ac072760f	Crude Oil Torn Between Iran Election, Coronavirus and G20 Summit	Crude oil prices will be closely watching the outcome of Iran’s parliamentary election as tensions between Washington and Tehran grow from sanctions and proxy attacks the US has accused Iran of orchestrating. Many see the upcoming vote as a referendum on the current administration whose voter base has grown frustrated with President Hassan Rouhani in the face of crippling sanctions and global isolation. The disillusioned moderate voters – who constitute the bulk of the current administration’s support base – have expressed frustration with the economic circumstances and are calling for a nation-wide boycott of the election. Consequently, this increases the probability that the majority of the Parliament’s 290 seats will be filled with conservative hardliners. Their ideological predilections more closely mirror that of the Guardian Council, Iran’s constitutionally-mandated 12-member legislative body. Their policy towards the US is comparatively more antagonistic than that of Mr. Rouhani’s, and as such, could raise the possibility of reignited stress. Consequently, the prospect of a supply disruption through escalated tensions could push crude oil prices higher. Crude Oil chart created using TradingView Financial markets continue to be held hostage by fear over the spread and impact of the coronavirus on global growth and how it may influence China’s economic dynamics. There are premonitions that a slowdown in Asia’s powerhouse could ripple out across the region and further disrupt supply chains and derail the recovery in global growth that was just beginning to show signs of stabilization. As the second largest consumer of crude oil, weaker demand out of China could further pressure crude oil which are still licking its wounds from the wounds after a politically turbulent two years. The spread of the coronavirus and rising death toll may begin to seep into key economic data – like PMIs – and infect sentiment of producers who may start thinking the outlook is not as bright as they had suspected. “Uncertainty is becoming the new normal” IMF Director Kristalina Georgieva said at a conference last week, warning that the coronavirus is “a stark reminder of how a fragile recovery could be threatened by unforeseen events”. In this environment, growth-oriented commodities like crude oil will be under pressure as demand for a vital input wilts alongside expectations for robust economic growth. G20 Finance Ministers and central bank governors will be meeting in Saudi Arabia from February 22-23 where the main topic of discussion will be the cost and impact of the coronavirus on the global economy. Downbeat commentary there from officials whose views carry a high premium in market opinion could dampen sentiment and further pressure crude oil prices. --- Written by Dimitri Zabelin, Jr Currency Analyst for DailyFX.com To contact Dimitri, use the comments section below or @ZabelinDimitrion Twitter	USD
5e7f90e01c21845f70972791	Gold Prices May Drop as Liquidation Strikes Global Markets Anew	Gold prices launched a spirited recovery last week, chalking up the largest rise since December 2008 when global markets were churning amid the global financial crisis. The rebound preceded two weeks of intense selling as broad-based liquidation as the swelling coronavirus outbreak seized up credit markets and triggered a stampede to cash. The rebound came as the Fed made QE open-ended having previously offered a fixed $700 billion program. That seemed to ease investors’ angst, sending gold higher alongside stocks as assets on the chopping block amid panic selling recovered while the US Dollar fell. The moves implied that traders believed in the US central bank’s capacity to keep credit flowing, which also spoke to the metal’s anti-fiat pedigree. At the same time, supply disruptions were announced from a slew of mines along with the Perth Mint, Australia’s official bullion-making operation, and South Africa’s Rand Refinery, the world’s largest metals processing outfit. That appeared to blow out the “delivery risk premium” as the spread between spot gold and the front-month futures contract ballooned in the latter’s favor. Interestingly, credit markets themselves were curiously impervious to the Fed-inspired pivot elsewhere across the asset spectrum. The so-called TED spread – a measure of US Dollar funding costs used to gauge liquidity conditions – continues to hover the peaks set amid last week’s cash crunch. That may be as a deep global recession appears increasingly probable. The Fed’s boldness may have soothed jittery investors for a bit, but its massive stimulus program and a similarly giant fiscal effort will struggle to fuel economic recovery while entire nations are huddled behind closed doors. Cheap borrowed capital and subsidized purchasing power mean little when business has ground to near-standstill in the cause of containment. The week ahead offers plenty of data points to illustrate the degree of economic pain being felt around the world. PMI surveys from a broad range of major economies are due to cross the wires while the US is set to publish the latest batch of official labor market statistics. If this convinces traders that the road to recovery will be a long slog despite policymakers’ explosive efforts, renewed liquidation may sink gold again. --- Written by Ilya Spivak, Sr. Currency Strategist for DailyFX.com To contact Ilya, use the comments section below or @IlyaSpivakon Twitter	USD
5e663723e52bb95729c8ab10	Dow Jones, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 Crash, US Recession Ahead?	Dow Jones, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 Price Analysis & News If the spread of the coronavirus crippling global demand enough to topple for equity markets, they now have to contend with an all out oil price war. In reaction to the weekend events, global equities gapped significantly lower at the open with E-Mini S&P 500 futures hitting limit down. As it stands, US indices are trading with heavy losses (Dow Jones -5%, Nasdaq 100 -5.1%, S&P 500 -5.1%) much like their global counterparts. The worst hit being the FTSE MIB (-9%) as the spread of the coronavirus forces 16mln citizens into quarantine. The move lower across equity markets has also coincided with the distressed signals sent by the bond market as US yields drop below 1% across the entire curve. In turn, money markets are pricing in a 59% chance that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to 0% (0-0.25% target range) with risks significantly rising that the US could dip into a technical recession. (Credit stress in high yield debt likely to signal large concerns for shale producers). How to Invest During a Recession: Investments & Strategy Circuit-breakersS&P 500 guidelines: Little in the way of notable support for the S&P 500 after crashing through the 50% Fibonacci retracement situated at 2856. Risks remain heavily tilted to the downside with the doors open towards a possible drop to 2728 (61.8% Fibonacci retracement). Declines in the Dow Jones have been briefly halted with support situated at 24554, however, any bounces are likely to be short-lived and shallow in the absence of notable positive news. Coronavirus cases in the US remain relatively low given the lack of testing and thus the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better. A firm break of current support leaves the index vulnerable to a deeper retracement towards 24000. Source: IG Charts The Nasdaq 100 gapped below its 200DMA and much like the Dow Jones and S&P 500, the index remains weak. The index appears on course for a break below the 8000 level as uncertainty remains rife. Notable support is situated at 7768, which marks the 50% fib, however, failure to hold raises the likelihood of a 7500 test.

5e5d088a73d82f5acc8afc6c	Worries of Coronavirus Plague World Markets	As I sit at my desk this morning the first headline, I see is “Head of WHO expert team to China urges the global community to move fast in their control measures to stop the virus from spreading”. Obviously, this is what many traders of already been thinking as stock market indices around the world have been selling off all day. The S&P 500 is currently down 2.5% near 3250, while the FTSE and DAX are currently down 3.4% and 3.75%, respectively. Although the motto has been “buy the dip” in stocks for the last number of years, one has to wonder if this can be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. Source: Tradingveiw, FOREX.com With new Coronavirus cases in Italy, fears are spreading that the virus may move further into Europe. Northern Italy has canceled public celebrations and closed schools to try and stop the coronavirus from spreading and neighboring countries are considering closing the borders. In addition, cases in Iran have spread and Pakistan has closed the border. One has to consider how many unconfirmed cases there are in that region. Gold is up another 1.8% as stocks markets have been selling off. As we discussed in the Chart to Watch in our Week Ahead article on Friday, the target of 1720 from the longer term flag formation is now within sight! Buyers will be looking for pullbacks towards 1650 to add to longs. This level is near the gap fill from overnight. Source: Tradingveiw, FOREX.com Interesting, USD/JPY is holding up. Although the pair is down on the day, with the equity sell off today one would think nicely near 111.30. USD/JPY is only down 40 pips from today’s highs. This may be because the GPIF still buying and reallocating into foreign bonds. Or, this may be from fears of the spread of the coronavirus in Japan, therefore taking away the yen as a “flight to safety”. We may see continued buying on dips towards 110.30/50. There is horizontal support, as well as trendline support from the long-term symmetrical triangle near these levels. Source: Tradingveiw, FOREX.com Over the next few days and weeks, comments from officials at the WHO and CDC regarding the coronavirus will be closely scrutinized. In addition, watch for any comments from senior government officials in Italy, Japan, South Korea, Iran, and other countries regarding the spread of the virus. Stocks and gold will be very sensitive to these comments.	JPY
5e7028dcfc137c62b3b004fd	Economic Data Puts the EUR, GBP and US Dollar in Focus. Coronavirus News Updates Will Need Monitoring, However	It was a relatively busy start to the week on the economic calendar this morning. The Kiwi Dollar and Aussie Dollar were in action through the early part of the day, with economic data out and monetary policy in focus. While economic data was in focus, the markets also reacted to the overnight moves in the U.S. A realization that neither monetary nor fiscal policy would offset the immediate impact of the virus remains evident across the global financial markets. Later in the morning, finalized industrial production figures out of Japan would likely have a muted impact on risk appetite. Consumer sentiment for the 1st quarter was in focus early in the session. The Westpac Consumer Sentiment Index slid from 109.9 to 104.2 in the 1st quarter. According to the latest Westpac report, Looking at the sub-indexes, consumers appeared to be concerned with the near-term economic outlook, but less concerned over its impact on personal finances. The Kiwi Dollar moved from $0.60524 to $0.60430 upon release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Kiwi Dollar was up by 0.73% to $0.6089. House prices were on the rise in the 4th quarter, with the house price index rising by 3.9%, following a 2.4% increase in the 3rd quarter. Economists had forecast a 3.9% increase. According to the ABS, The RBA meeting minutes garnered a greater degree of attention, however, with the markets eager to get a sense of what’s next. Salient points from the 3rd March Minutes included, The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.61119 to $0.61154 upon release of the stats and minutes. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was up by 0.20% to $0.6129, with no major surprises in the minutes to hit the Aussie. At the time of writing, the Japanese Yen was down by 0.81% to ¥106.69 against the U.S Dollar. It’s a relatively busy day ahead on the economic calendar. Economic data includes ZEW Economic Sentiment figures for Germany and the Eurozone and 4th quarter Eurozone wage growth figures. Expect the March sentiment figures to have a greater influence from the economic calendar. The March figures will reflect the impact of the coronavirus on economist and analyst sentiment towards the economic outlook. We would expect any positive numbers to have a muted impact on the EUR, with the outlook towards the Eurozone economy dire for now. While the ECB’s latest monetary policy move could see outflows from the EUR, the unwind of carry trades is unlikely to abate near-term. There are just too many unknowns to support a drive towards emerging market currencies at present. At the time of writing, the EUR was down by 0.10% at $1.1172. It’s a busy day ahead on the economic calendar. January’s unemployment and wage growth figures are due out along with February claimant counts. We’ve seen the BoE deliver monetary policy support, with more on the cards as BoE Governor Carney heads for the door. Any spike in claimant counts and slide in wage growth would certainly be a bad combination. Negative numbers would support another move by the BoE, particularly with other central banks throwing in the kitchen sink. At the time of writing, the Pound was down by 0.24% to $1.2241. It’s a busy day ahead on the U.S economic calendar. February retail sales and industrial production figures are due out along with January’s JOLT’s job openings and business inventories. Expect retail sales to have the greatest impact, with January’s JOLTs job openings unlikely to reflect the effects of the coronavirus. When considering the retail sales figures, expect weak numbers to have a greater impact, with sales likely to plummet in March and April. Outside of the numbers, there’s always the U.S administration there to deliver Dollar weakness… The Dollar Spot Index was up by 0.07% to 98.141 at the time of writing. It’s a relatively busy day ahead on the economic calendar, with manufacturing sales and foreign securities purchases in focus. The January numbers are unlikely to move the dial, with the coronavirus yet to have shown its teeth at the start of the year. With the FED slashing rates to zero and spooking the markets, crude oil prices tanked on Monday. Price action added further pressure on the BoC to deliver more… We’ve seen plenty of emergency moves, the BoC may not be in a position to wait… The Loonie was up by 0.22% at C$1.3985 against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing, with early support coming from a rise in crude oil prices.

5e7177b7829a163db03e37f5	Dollar thrives, Aussie trampled in rush for liquidity	SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar held overnight gains against most major currencies on Wednesday, after U.S. yields jumped and as deepening fear around the coronavirus drove a scramble for greenback. The pound and safe-haven yen made the best efforts at recovery, but only managed to recoup fractions of their losses. The yen was last up 0.3% at 107.37 per dollar, the pound up 0.5% at $1.2108 and the euro was steady at $1.1000. Commodity-sensitive currencies, like the Aussie and kiwi, were trampled below $0.60 in the stampede. All are well below where they were a week ago as investors sell just about everything for dollars and businesses seek to draw down loans and hoard cash to ride out the crisis. “It all stems from a shortage of US dollars,” said Gunter Seeger, senior vice president in investment-grade fixed income at New York asset manager PineBridge Investments. Dislocation in the U.S. bond market, where the yield on government debt has gyrated wildly for the past week, illustrates the desperation for cash, he said, even as the U.S. Federal Reserve pumps huge amounts of liquidity into the system. “People are very, very nervous,” Seeger said. “Everyone’s nervous about the virus, about oil prices, about their job, about everything.” Meanwhile the coronavirus only spreads, as country after country adopts draconian social restrictions and a war-footing mentality to try and contain the outbreak. The global death toll is above 7,800, the number of cases is approaching 200,000 and the economic fallout of what is in effect a global lockdown is spiralling. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasuries jumped 34 basis points higher overnight, the largest single-day rise since 2004 - further illustrating how massive selling is testing liquidity in even the deepest and broadest markets. The higher yield also adds yet more attraction to owning dollars, amid growing signs of tight supply - especially abroad. Cross-currency basis swap spreads, which show the cost of borrowing dollars abroad, hit their widest in years. Three-month euro/dollar cross-currency basis swap spreads rose as high as 120 basis points - its widest since late 2011 - before falling back to 39 basis points. Spreads for the Aussie and yen also widened dramatically. Risk currencies were also pounded with the mood, and nursed deep losses on Wednesday. The Australian dollar has made its first trip under 60 cents since 2003 and last sat at $0.5998, while the kiwi was at $0.5955. The Australian dollar has lost nearly 15% against the greenback this year. “In the context of the highly elevated levels of risk aversion and depths to which commodity prices have fallen...we said last week that both Antipodean currencies were on borrowed time above 0.60,” said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB.

5e81b610c496d2354de73044	Dollar drives higher	Wednesday February 6: Five things the markets are talking about European equities are on the back foot after a surprise drop in German factory orders this morning added to signs that the region’s strongest economy is struggling. The EUR (€1.1380) has fallen to its lowest level outright in a fortnight on the news, after German manufacturing orders had dropped by -1.6% from November. This has confused market consensus, who were expecting a +0.3% rise. Even U.S stock futures seem unfazed by President Trump’s State of the Union address last night, which has proved “fairly uneventful.” Nevertheless, the ‘big’ dollar has extended its gains alongside U.S Treasuries. Asia overnight saw another muted session, with trading rested mostly by the Lunar New Year holidays. Down-under, Australia’s dollar tumbled after the RBA’s Governor Lowe indicated a shift to a “neutral” stance on monetary policy. Later this evening, capital markets will be looking for some directional clues from Fed Chair Powell’s first public comments (07:00 pm EDT) following last month’s monetary policy meeting and interest-rate decision. On tap: Earnings season continues, with reports from Twitter and MetLife. 1. Stocks battered and bruised Markets were closed in China, Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and also in New Zealand. In Japan, the Nikkei edged a tad higher overnight despite investors barely reacting to Trump’s State of the Union address. Their attention remains on corporate earnings. The Nikkei share average rallied +0.1% while the broader Topix declined -0.1%. Down-under, Aussie shares edged higher as fears of an iron ore supply shortage supported mining stocks, but gains were capped by a profit miss from one of the country’s top financial lenders – Commonwealth Bank of Australia – the S&P/ASX 200 index closed up +0.3%. The benchmark surged +2% on Tuesday. Note: U.S and Chinese officials are poised to start another round of trade talks in Beijing next week to try and avert a March 2 increase in U.S tariffs on Chinese goods. In Europe, regional bourses are trading slightly lower across the board, consolidating after yesterday’s sharp gains with corporate earnings the key theme. U.S stocks are set to open a tad under pressure (-0.1%). Indices: Stoxx600 +0.76% at 326.66, FTSE +1.16% at 7,115.75, DAX +0.93% at 11,280.14, CAC-40 +0.80% at 5,040.26, IBEX-35 +0.66% at 9,034.25, FTSE MIB +0.99% at 19,800.50, SMI +0.82% at 9,092.50, S&P 500 Futures -0.12% 2. Oil higher, but global outlook caps gains, gold little changed Oil prices are a tad higher for the first time in three sessions ahead of the open stateside, although market concerns over the outlook for the global economy has capped gains. Brent crude oil futures are at +$62.05 per barrel, up +7c, after closing down -0.8% yesterday, while U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures are at +$53.74 per barrel, up +8c from their last settlement. They closed down -1.7% on Tuesday. Analysts note that there are currently little signs of any overhang in the market now that the U.S has imposed sanctions on Venezuela, on top of the reduced supply from Saudi Arabia. Note: Last week, the U.S administration announced export sanctions against state-owned oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA (approx. +500k bpd) – this has led to some disruption for oil refineries on the Gulf coast. They have had to seek alternative heavy crude supplies from Canada. OPEC supply fell this month by the largest amount in two-years, which has helped to offset limited compliance so far by non-OPEC Russia. Nevertheless, API data yesterday showed that U.S crude stocks rose last week even as refineries boosted output, while gasoline and distillate stocks also increased – crude inventories rose by +2.5M barrels in the week ended Feb. 1 to +448.2M, compared with expectations for an increase of +2.2M barrels. Ahead of the open stateside, gold prices are holding firm after U.S President Trump in his State of the Union speech again promised to build a border wall and gave little clarity over the ongoing trade discussions with China. However, the ‘yellow’ metals gains have been somewhat offset by a stronger U.S dollar. Spot gold is steady at +$1,314 per ounce, while gold futures are also steady at +$1,318 an ounce. 3. Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) shifts to ‘neutral’ The AUD (A$0.7136) has been hit hard in the overnight session on news the RBA has adopted a neutral policy bias, stating that the Australian economy “could be weaker than it thinks and that the risks to the economic outlook are more balanced.” Nevertheless, Governor Lowe remains upbeat on the Aussie job market, but has given the RBA the latitude to cut interest rates should growth fall short of expectations and the unemployment rate start to rise. Elsewhere, the yield on 10-year Treasuries has decreased by -2 bps to +2.68%. In Germany, the 10-year Bund yield has fallen -1 bps to +0.16%, while in the U.K the 10-year Gilt yield has dipped -2 bps to +1.209%. In Japan, the 10-year JGP yield has declined less than -1 bps to -0.013%. 4. Dollar drives higher EUR/USD (€1.1395) is a tad softer by -0.2% and holding below the psychological €1.14 level. The ‘single’ unit of choice has come under pressure after Germany December Factory Orders (see below) continued the string of disappointing European data. GBP has dropped -0.6% to $1.2957, posting a four-day decline. Yesterday’s Markit U.K Services PMI dipped to 50.1 in January (vs. 51.0 expected), the lowest since July 2016, from 51.2 in December. The Bank of England (BoE) is widely expected to keep its monetary policy unchanged Thursday (07:00 am EDT). AUD/USD (A$0.7136) is on track for its biggest decline in 12-months after the RBA tweaked its forward rate guidance to a more ‘dovish’ stance. RBA now sees its rate outlook as more “evenly balanced” compared to the prior view that next rate move was likely to be higher. 5. German manufacturing orders collapsed in December Data out of Europe showed that German manufacturing orders collapsed in December, led by a sharp drop in orders from outside the eurozone. According to Germany’s statistical office that manufacturing orders declined -1.6% in December m/m, while the market had expected a rise of +0.3%. Commenting on the weak result, the economics ministry said “the dry spell in German industry” appears to be continuing and that the “recent sentiment indicators also point to subdued industrial activity at the start of the year.” Note: Compared with December 2017, German manufacturing orders dropped -7.0%.

5e82a986bb7a79547aef1bb6	A Busy Economic Calendar Puts the EUR, GBP and USD in Focus	It was a busy day on the economic calendar this morning. The Aussie Dollar, Kiwi Dollar, and Japanese Yen were in action through the Asian session. There were also the latest coronavirus numbers for the markets to consider. At the time of writing, the total number of U.S cases stood at 163,479. For Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, the combined number of cases stood at 301,130. The total global number of cases rose to 784,381. February building consents and March business confidence figures were in focus. In February, building consents rose by 4.7%, reversing a 2% slide from January. Economists had forecast a 1% rise. The Kiwi Dollar moved from $0.60103 to $0.60087 upon release of the figures that preceded the business confidence figures. In March, the ANZ Business Confidence Index fell from -19.4 to 63.5. Economists had forecast a fall to -24.1. According to the latest ANZ Report, The Kiwi Dollar moved from $0.60087 to $0.60148 upon release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Kiwi Dollar was flat at $0.6011. Industrial production and retail sales figures for February were in focus early in the day. According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, retail sales jumped by 1.7% in February, year-on-year, reversing a 0.4% fall in January. Economists had forecast a 1.2% decline. Industrial production increased by 0.40% in February, according to prelim figures, following a 1.0% rise in January. Economists had forecast a 0.1% rise. According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, Industries that mainly contributed to the increase were: Industries that mainly contributed to a decrease were Forecasts for industrial production continued to point to a slide in March, however, while positive for April. For March, industrial production is forecasted to fall by 5.3% and then rise by 7.5% in April. The Japanese Yen moved from ¥108.104 to ¥108.066 upon release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Japanese Yen was down by 0.71% to ¥108.53 against the U.S Dollar. February new home sales and private sector credit figures were in focus ahead of March private sector PMIs out of China. In February, new home sales jumped by 6.2%, following a 5.7% rise in January. Economists had forecast a 1.9% decline. The Aussie Dollar moved from 0.61647 to $0.61699 upon release of the figures. Private sector credit numbers were also positive. According to figures released by RBA, total credit increased by 0.4%, month-on-month, in February. In January, credit had risen by 0.3%. The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.61785 to $0.61882 upon release of the RBA’s figures that preceded March PMI numbers out of China. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was down by 0.23% to $0.6160. March private sector PMIs provided much-needed relief. According to the National Bureau of Statistics: The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.61489 to $0.61582 upon release of the figures. It’s a busy day ahead on the economic calendar. Key stats March unemployment numbers out of Germany and the Eurozone’s prelim March inflation figures. French consumer spending figures for February, 4th quarter GDP numbers out of Spain and prelim March inflation figures out of Italy should have a muted impact on the day. Expect German unemployment figures to have the greatest influence on the day, with the markets prepped for softer inflationary pressures. When considering Germany’s unemployment numbers, the markets will also need to assume that worse is yet to come. Outside of the stats, the latest updates on the coronavirus numbers will also provide direction. A smaller increase in the number of new cases would provide support to the EUR. At the time of writing, the EUR was down by 0.32% at $1.1013. It’s a relatively busy day ahead on the economic calendar. Finalized 4th quarter GDP and business investment numbers will likely have a muted impact on the Pound, however. The BoE and the government have already made their moves and the markets should now be looking forward and not back to the 4th quarter. Outside of the numbers, the number of new cases in the UK would need to be on the lower side, however, for the Pound to find support. Updates from Brexit talks will also be in focus on the day. A failure to find common ground will raise the Brexit stress levels… At the time of writing, the Pound was down by 0.71% to $1.2326. It’s a relatively quiet day ahead on the U.S economic calendar. March consumer confidence figures will grab the limelight later today. With weak numbers expected, there should be some resilience to the figures. The markets are all too aware of the shutdown in the U.S and surge in jobless claims. This is undoubtedly going to be reflected in the confidence figures. January house price figures and Chicago PMI numbers for March will likely have a muted impact on the Dollar… While the markets will consider the numbers, we will need to digests April and May figures now to get a sense of how extended the economic meltdown will be… Trump’s decision to hold back from easing containment measures until the end of April suggests more doom and gloom ahead. The Dollar Spot Index was up by 0.31% to 99.489 at the time of writing. It’s a quiet day ahead on the economic calendar, with January GDP and February RMPI numbers unlikely to provide any direction. The Loonie will remain in the hands of the global financial markets and risk sentiment over the course of the day. While the BoC has made its near-term moves, a lot now depends upon government success at containing the virus… The Loonie was down by 0.25% at C$1.4201 against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing.

5e95bacf1c2494614ec77265	The currencies and gold team up on the dollar!	"Good Day… And a Tom Terrific Tuesday to you! Well, my Zoom meeting with my heart doc. didn’t take place yesterday as planned… I guess no one showed up in his office to work! Sign of the times, I guess, they’ll call to reschedule at some point… I've been on my new chemo for 5 doses and I'm already wanting to sleep all the time.... UGH! I have a mea culpa today, some more thoughts on where all this is going, and more, so stay tuned! But first…. Alice In Chains greets me this morning with their “unplugged” version of their song: Down In A Hole…. Which is exactly where a lot of citizens of the U.S. are these days…. I got to thinking about those stimulus checks…. Like I told Dennis Miller’s (www.milleronthemoney.com) readers in an interview we recently did, “what are the citizen’s going to do with the money? Maybe pay some bills but that doesn’t really help the economy right now, they need to spend it, but who’s open?” Well, add to that my latest gloomy, put you in a bad mood, thought…. Citizens will get up to $1,200 each, so a household could see $2,400 (see that math I just did in my head? Amazing!), and that’s all well and good, but…. Think about the Corporations getting bailed out for their years of loading up on debt, and buying back their respective stocks, instead of putting the money into the corporation (CAPEX)…. And then the icing on my “gloomy, put you in a bad mood, thought” is the very idea that Wall Street Casino Banks are getting BILLIONS of dollars! That’s Billions with a Capital B! Ok, how was that to start the day? Get your blood flowing, heart rate and pulse up, and now you’re ready to take on the world? I sure hope so, because mine is, just from thinking about that and typing it! Now, you’re wanting something good to read about, to balance this out, right? Well, how about Gold turning the $7 downside in the early morning trading into a $18 gain on the day, which makes the total turnaround $25! Yes, Gold pushed past the short Gold paper trades yesterday, and traded through the $1,700 figure, to close the day at $1,717!!!!!! Onward and upward as my good friend, and new grandpa, Frank Trotter, would always tell me when I would enter his office in a foul mood, with something on my mind, only to leave forgetting what I had gone in there mad about! We called these Jedi Mind Tricks…. I could use some of those Jedi Mind Tricks right now with all this stuff going on…. Think about that for a minute before we go on…. Since March started, and came in like a lamb…. We had the Saudis and Russians bring their dispute on production cuts to a standstill, which caused a HUGE chunk of the Oil Price to slip away…. Then we had the beginnings of shut downs, Spring Training, then restaurants, bars, churches, the beach, and then pools, and any other place you can think where people gather, shut down…. Shoot, they even shut down tennis courts…. Now that’s a sport that practices social distancing, right? Didn’t matter, shut down! In the 70’s the band April Wine had a song where they would say… Shot.... down…. That’s what all this feels like… the economy is… Shot... Down! The dollar was busy losing ground to Gold yesterday, and the currencies traded flat pretty much for the day, with the Aussie dollar (A$) getting in some body shots to the dollar bugs…. I was thinking about the A$’s move yesterday, and wondered what was behind this move, given that the Aussies have opened up their printing press too…. Well, again this goes back to the “look” that the U.S. has now and their pledge to shepherd the reserve currency of the world with care…. It’s not looking like they’re holding up their end of the bargain, for getting the ability to print at will, get commodities cheaper, have Oil priced in dollars, and so on…. In the overnight markets, the dollar was sold lower. It looks like a tag team wrestling match.... yesterday, it was Gold's turn to blister the dollar, and then they tagged the currencies and overnight it was the currencies to blister the dollar... This could very well turn out to yet another false dawn with regards to a sustained selling of the dollar, but, what if it isn't? The Dollar Index which about 10 days ago was 102 and change, and this morning it's barely hanging on to 99.... I've been waiting for the strong dollar trend to end for good, for the last couple of years, and to wet my whistle, the currencies would go on these mini-rallies, VS the dollar, only to get everyone on board that the strong dollar trend was over, and then, poof! The rally was over, and the dollar bugs were back on top of the hill doing a dance to rub it in.... I read this morning that our friends (NOT!) at OPEC plus, came to an agreement on production cuts for Oil, but does it really matter when there’s little to no demand right now worldwide? The Russians get it, they see there’s no demand, so why cut the production to hopefully raise the price when it doesn’t matter right now… They tried to make the Saudi’s see it their way, but that didn’t happen, and they finally gave in... So the OPEC+ group of nations will cut oil production by 9.7 Million barrels a day…. The “plus” countries include: Russia, and Mexico, who by the way had been the last fly in the production cut plan’s ointment…. Mexico? Really? Oh well…. We carry on… Speaking of Oil…. I was reading my weekly edition of Things That Make You Go Hmmmm…. From Grant Williams yesterday (it arrived Sunday night), but to me, it makes sense…. And in the group of letters he had in there was an article titled: CORONAVIRUS MAY KILL OUR FRACKING FEVER DREAM: BETHANY MCLEAN Got your attention? Well, she goes into how the Shale Producing Companies were so badly in debt before the COVID-19 virus came along, and now they don’t have any production to help…. I read some things here that I always “felt were true” but now I know that they are! Our dream of being energy independent is floating out to see folks… Sort of like those Viking funerals where they set the boat on fire and send it out to sea… I’m just telling you these things to back up what I’ve told you about the how the Rig counts were falling, and the Shale Oil production was falling too, weren’t just me spouting off about something I had no business spouting off about! Why does everything in this country have to have a Political slant to it? When the first stimulus bill, that was supposed to get money in the hands of people who had lost their jobs due to the economic shutdown of the economy, as the pandemic spread, we had Political fighting back and forth, name calling and finger pointing. The bill finally went through, but was packed with all kinds of Pork it's crazy! And now the thoughts that they didn't do enough for the people with the first bill, they'll have some political wrangling and wrestle with each other over it, before it comes out looking nothing like it was supposed to.... I'm going to harp on this thought over and over until the cows come home folks, but I just don't see why Corporations get to be bailed out by taxpayers, after years of neglect to their own respective balance sheets... Reminds me of the Aesop fable about the ant and the grasshopper... the Ant is the taxpayer, saving and stretching their earnings, and the grasshopper is the Corporations, spending their earnings and then borrowing some more to buy back their stocks, and when the fit hits the shan, they come back with their tails between their respective legs, and beg for a bail out.... It's downright shameful that 1. they do this, and 2. that we let them! I've said this for years, well since 2009, and I'll say it again until they colonize Mars, and that is.... IF.... we had not meddled in the economy in 2008, with bailouts, but with support so that the financial system didn't fail, that the years 2010, and 11 might have been pretty ugly, but, then all the excesses of the years that the Fed didn't allow the economy to get rid of them, would be gone, and we would have been building an economy that was stronger, and without all the added debt... Then IF real smart people would have figured out that we needed to reintroduce the Glass Stegal Act and not allow the Large Brokerage Houses to buy Banks, and become Casino Banks, many would things be different today.... And the Covid-19 virus, shutdown wouldn't look like it could damage the economy for years to come, like it does now.... I'm just saying.... As I told you yesterday, the U.S. Data Cupboard won't have anything for us to really look to until tomorrow.... So, we can simply move along here for these aren't the droids we're looking for..... Well…. One of my first bosses in the banking business, Ed Bonawitz, sent me a note yesterday, with a link to the fact check organization that debunked the claim by David Stockman that the House gave themselves a $25 million raise in the stimulus bill…. So, now I’m at a loss as to whom I should believe, David Stockman, the former budget director for President Reagan, or the fact check folks? I guess the fact check folks don’t have a book to sell like Stockman does, so I’ll say sorry to the House folks for saying that they took a raise, but I won’t say I’m sorry for all the other things I said about them! To recap.... Gold took off for the stars yesterday, crossing the $1,700 figure on the way, then tagged the currencies in the overnight markets, where they took their turn blistering the dollar. The A$ is really moving higher these days, and that has Chuck scratching his bald head, but then when you think of what the U.S. has done to mar the dollar, he sees the light.... Remember the ant and the grasshopper? Well, believe it or don't, but Chuck weaves that fable into the letter this morning.... For What It’s Worth… I was going through my email box this past weekend, and noticed an email that I must have missed reading. It was from longtime reader Bob, who sends me stuff all the time, and this one was well worth the read, as it was about a run on a credit union in Baltimore a week ago. “The evolution of panic hoarding started with 3M N95 masks, then hand sanitizers, non-perishable foods, guns and ammo, and now cash? A video surfaced on Instagram on Saturday, showing a possible bank run in Baltimore City at the MECU Credit Union, located at 2337 E Northern Pkwy. The area is considered low/middle class working families (predominantly African American community). The video shows a large line of cars on Saturday afternoon and a line at the ATM. People weren't cashing in their paychecks because many people were laid off, as we noted, more than 14 million people in the last several weeks have lost their jobs across the county, and what we could be looking at is the beginnings of a bank run. As soon as the National Guard rolled into Baltimore City – many folks asked themselves – is this a revisit of the Freddy Gray unrest back in 2015,"" said Teresa Davis, owner and operator of Teresa Davis Productions. Davis said residents are going to the local banks because they fear banks are going to fail, and unrest could be nearing. ""They want their monies out,"" Davis said, adding that some people in the community have been watching their 401ks crash, and others have been watching the news that a recession could be imminent. Last month, the smart money in Mid-Town Manhattan and Hamptons were withdrawing as much cash as they could, with at least one bank running out of $100 bills.” Chuck Again… Coming to a bank near you! As I said last week or sometime I don’t recall exactly when, “when the Fed cuts rates and they go negative, people will attempt to get their cash out of the bank rather than have it there for the bank to charge them for holding it…. This is just a precursor to what we will see soon…. Oh, and when that happens…. Pandora’s Box of digital currencies will be thrown at us…. More on that some other time….

5e78d77b6139d55e81f197df	US Dollar Mired by FX Volatility & Expanded Fed Arsenal	The US Dollar has notched an incredible surge over the last two weeks. In fact, the US Dollar Index, or DXY Index, is up a whopping 7% since its March 09 low. Greenback gains have been largely attributed to demand for safe-haven currencies recently dominating forex market dynamics. This has resulted primarily from sustained risk aversion amid the coronavirus pandemic, which continues to plague the world and paralyze economic activity. In response to economic fallout stemming from the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, global central banks have coordinated to provide massive amounts of stimulus via interest rate cuts and quantitative easing. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView After this morning’s eye-popping headline that the Fed announced unlimited QE crossed the wires, however, the US Dollar has begun to come under pressure. Specifically, the Federal Reserve revealedextensive new measures to support the economy like boosting purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage backed securities “in the amounts needed to support.” In addition to unlimited balance sheet expansion, or QE-infinity, the FOMC announced a monumental change to its monetary policy arsenal: a new credit facility to purchase US investment grade corporate bonds off the open market – including US listed exchange traded funds (ETFs) like the iShares investment grade corporate bond ETF (ticker symbol: LQD). With the Fed ramping up asset purchases, and the market supply of USD circulating the financial system, the broader US Dollar is starting to pull back from three-year highs with the DXY Index trading at session lows. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView I recently noted that the surging US Dollar hit a wall last week as the DXY Index seemed overextended. At the same time, extremely high readings of currency volatility might look to keep USD price action and US Dollar Index supported. On that note, FXVIX, an equally-weighted index of 30-day implied volatility readings on the Euro, Pound Sterling and Yen, just skyrocketed to its highest reading on record. Nevertheless, while the US Dollar may be due for a modest pullback, high volatility is still a threat to global markets and could reflect how the risk of recession continues to loom large. With other volatility benchmarks pressing decade highs and levels not seen since the global financial crisis, such as the VIX Index, risk aversion might linger and keep the US Dollar bolstered. -- Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight	USD
5e5fc5864cf5e15b18d85c96	Emergency rate cuts are leaving currency experts bullish on the euro	"The euro is expected to strengthen against the U.S. dollar in the coming months, regardless of whether the European Central Bank (ECB) announces further stimulus measures. The pair traded at roughly $1.115 on Wednesday. The euro was nearing a two-month high against the greenback, while the U.S. dollar lost some ground as currency traders weighed the latest move from the U.S. Federal Reserve. The central bank announced a surprise rate cut of 50 basis points on Tuesday morning to help contain the economic impact of the coronavirus. ""That the ECB has far less room than the Fed to lower the short-term policy rate is obvious. U.S. short term rates therefore look to converge on those in Europe, which we think is enough to briefly push EUR/USD to 1.15 in the second quarter,"" Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany said in a note Tuesday. Market players have priced in a higher chance that the ECB will also cut rates next week, but its main interest rates are at a lower level compared to those in the U.S. The ECB's deposit rate — which is the interest that the central bank provides to financial institutions that deposit cash at the ECB — stands at -0.5. Following Tuesday's decision, the Fed's benchmark funds rate sits now between 1%-1.25%. The Fed has tried to normalize policy at different times since the global financial crisis. Overall, the U.S. economy has managed to recover from the crisis at a much faster rate compared to the euro zone. As a result, the ECB has struggled to normalize, having stopped its massive bond-buying program in late 2018, only to then restart it less than a year later. ""Even before the coronavirus, we expected the U.S. economy to decelerate further than what the consensus is expecting. And depending on whether financial markets stabilize or not, the Fed may also cut further. So, on the whole, we still expect the USD to depreciate further,"" Wolfgang Kiener, senior foreign exchange analyst at BayernLB, told CNBC Wednesday. Thus the dollar depreciation should contribute to a slightly stronger euro. Roberto Mialich, foreign exchange strategist at UniCredit, shared a similar view. He told CNBC that an expected deterioration of the U.S. economy should lead to further rate cuts. U.S. analysts at Goldman Sachs have actually predicted two new rates cuts between now and the end of April. Mialich from UniCredit expects the euro to be at $1.16 by the end of the year. ""Despite our rising EUR/USD profile into the end of the year, the critical thing to note is that we assume that EUR will remain structurally undervalued for another year,"" Kamal Sharma, G-10 foreign exchange strategy at Bank of America, told CNBC Wednesday."

5e5d08052e1fe5553d2b63d5	The RBA Holds as Focus Shifts to Economic data from the UK and the U.S	It was a busy day on the economic calendar through the Asian session this morning. Economic data included October Service sector PMI numbers out of China and October BRC Retail Sales Monitor numbers out of the UK. On the monetary policy front, the RBA also delivered its November interest rate decision and rate statement. On the geopolitical risk front, chatter on trade provided support for riskier assets in the early part of the day. Following talk of the U.S administration planning to issue licenses to U.S firms to sell to Huawei Technologies, there was also some chatter of pulling back on tariffs. The Caixin Services PMI fell from 51.3 to 51.1 in October. Economists had forecast a rise to 52.8. Supported by a pickup in manufacturing sector activity, however, the composite PMI rose from 51.9 to 52.0, its highest level since April. According to the October Survey, The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.68794 to $0.68852 upon release of the figures, which preceded the RBA’s interest rate decision. The RBA held rates unchanged at 0.75%, which was in line with market expectations. According to the RBA Rate Statement, The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.68864 to $0.68879 upon release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was up by 0.26% to $0.6902. At the time of writing, the Japanese Yen was down by 0.21% to ¥108.81 against the U.S Dollar, while the Kiwi Dollar was up by 0.11% to $0.6409. Risk-on sentiment through the session provided direction for the pair early on. It’s a quiet day ahead on the economic calendar. There are no material stats due out of the Eurozone to provide direction for the EUR. A lack of stats leaves the EUR in the hands of geopolitical risk and influence of corporate earnings on risk sentiment. At the time of writing, the EUR was down by 0.04% to $1.1124. It’s a relatively busy day ahead on the data front. October’s Services PMI and Composite PMIs are due out later this morning. We can expect the Service PMI to have an impact on the Pound, with forecasts Pound positive. Earlier in the day, the UK’s BRC Retail Sales Monitor rose by 0.1% in October, year-on-year, partially reversing a 1.7% slide from September. At the time of writing, the Pound was up by 0.01% to $1.2885. It’s a busy day ahead on the economic calendar. Key stats include September trade data, finalized Service Sector, and Composite PMI numbers and the markets preferred ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI. We can expect the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI to have the greatest influence on the day. Barring dire numbers, we can expect the JOLTs job openings for September to have a muted impact following the nonfarm payroll figures. Quit rates would need to avoid a sizeable fall, however. The Dollar Spot Index was up by 0.10% to 97.601 at the time of writing. It’s another quiet day on the economic calendar. There are no material stats due out of Canada later today. A lack of stats continues to leave the Loonie in the hands of market sentiment towards trade and influence on crude oil prices. The Loonie was down by 0.03% to C$1.3155, against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing.	GBP
5e786beffe73c15451f338f6	High Anxiety Is Already Baked In	The economic and financial reaction to the global pandemic has triggered a surge in the U.S. dollar, which itself may amplify the disruption that is evident throughout the capital markets. Yesterday's macro analysis piece focuses on the fundamental considerations behind the greenback's surge. This piece focuses specifically on the price action itself. One way to conceive of the price action is that it is a reflection of psychology. Not the Freudian psychology of the id, ego, and superego, of course, but crowd psychology. As an individual, we may learn, but crowd behavior seems repetitive, and hence patterns emerge. Also, technical studies can help quantify the risk and provide mile-marker-like levels. In equity investing, one can pay a downpayment of the purchase, as in buying on margin. In the over-the-counter markets, one does downpayment is not toward the purchase, but toward the future loss. How much can one lose before the position can be closed? This is a function of volatility. As volatility rises, participants are forced to trade smaller size or pony up more funds. Volatility often appears auto-correlated, which means the best guess for the next period volatility is the last period. High vol periods seem to come in clusters. That suggests that elevated volatility should be expected in the days ahead. In turn, that has implications for the placement of orders, slippage on execution, and the tolerance of violations of technical targets. Dollar Index: On March 9, the Dollar Index was sold to 94.65 its lowest level since September 2018. It has preceded to rally to 103.00, its best level since January 2017. The surge lifted the momentum indicators into over-extended territory, and they are not showing an imminent turn lower. The Dollar Index has closed above its upper Bollinger® Band (~100.87) for the past two sessions. The next upside chart points come from the late 2016/early 2017 high in the 103.55-103.80 area. Above there is little until August-September highs in 2002 (~108.75-109.25). Initial support may be in the 101.00-101.50 area. A break of that area, without going much higher first, could be an early sign that the surge is over. Euro: The single currency fell by about 3.75% last week following a nearly 1.6% decline the previous week. It traded in a six-cent range last week (~$1.0635-$1.1235). The last time a month had such a range that big was in January 2018. One-week implied volatility rose above 20% last week for the first time in four years. One-month implied volatility finished last week, around 14.3%. It had been near 6% at the end of February. The technical indicators do not point to a near-term euro bottom yet, and the next support area is around $1.05. However, the volatility means a move below $1.00 cannot be mathematically discounted. A move above $1.08 now is needed to stabilize the tone. Japanese Yen: The dollar reached JPY111.50 vs the yen ahead of the weekend as it nearly completes the round trip that began around JPY112.20 on February 20-21. It dropped like a rock to JPY101.20 on March 9. The technical indicators are not yet over-extended, and the upper Bollinger Band is near JPY112.25. The most acute shortage of dollars may not be from Japanese commercial banks, but other financial institutions and may not be addressed by the official dollar-swap lines. A move above the JPY112.50 area could target the JPY115 area. March 12 was the last session that the dollar took out the previous session's low. The pre-weekend low was about JPY109.35. Below there, support is seen in the JPY108.00-JPY108.35 area. British Pound: Sterling has been pounded for 11.3% since the nearly $1.3210 peak on March 9. It recorded a low a little above $1.14 ahead of the weekend, a level not seen since 1985. The low then was around $1.05. For the past three sessions, it has slipped below $1.15 intraday but has failed to close below it. The pre-weekend bounce fizzled near $1.1935, shy of the $1.20 psychological level and $1.21, the (38.2%) retracement of the sharp sell-off. The MACD and Slow Stochastic appear to be trying to bottom. One-week and one-month volatility reached nearly four-year highs of around 35.5% and 26.2%, respectively, last week. There have been ten-cent ranges in each of the past two weeks, and the softening of the implied volatility ahead of the weekend may be hinting that such ranges are unsustainable. Canadian Dollar: Since March 9, when the U.S. dollar bottomed against most of the major currencies, the Canadian dollar has been the strongest, losing only 4.6% of its value. Its 1% rally before the weekend solidified its standing. Although the Bank of Canada has cut rates 100 bp this month, at 75 bp, the policy rate is still 50 bp above the next highest G7 countries, including the U.S. Between the drop in oil prices and commodity prices more broadly, and the economic and financial disruption is going to be significant. The U.S. dollar reached almost CAD1.4670 on March 19 before dropping to nearly CAD1.4150 on March 20, helped by a surge in oil prices and a (brief) moment of stability in equities. The MACD looks to be about to level-off at extreme levels. The Slow Stochastic has been flatlining near its highs. After closing for three sessions about its upper Bollinger Band, the U.S. dollar moved back under it (~CAD1.4525) at the end of the week. The U.S. dollar approached the high from last 2016 near CAD1.4670. If this is overtaken, there is appears to be nothing on the charts to prevent a test on CAD1.50. Australian Dollar: The Australian dollar recorded back-to-back weekly declines of more than 6.5% (nearly 8.5 cents). It took out the lows from the Great Financial Crisis near $0.6000 and fell to almost $0.5500, last seen in October 2002.The pre-weekend session was the first since March 9 that the Aussie rose above the previous session's high to reach about $0.5965. It needs to recapture the $0.6000-$0.6030 area to give up that collapse is over. The announcement that the Federal Reserve was granting Australia (along with several other central banks) dollar-swap lines seems to help the spot. Still, the three-month cross-currency basis swap finished the week at what appears to be a record extreme. The Slow Stochastic appears slightly ahead of the MACD in suggesting a potential easing of the selling pressure. Volatility soared to levels not seen since last 2008, as one-week vol jumped above 46% and one-month role rose almost 38% (both were tenors were are 10% at the end of February). Mexican Peso: Initially, the dollar strengthened against the peso as carry-trades that were drawn to Mexico's high real and nominal rates were unwound. The greenback gains accelerated as the peso was sold alongside other emerging markets currencies. Mexico depends on tourism, and worker remittances as sources of hard currency, and these streams are evaporating. The government also seems slow to respond to the Covid-19 threat by closing down airports and restaurants, for example. Banxico delivered a 50 bp rate cut ahead of the weekend, but at 6.5% it is overnight rate remains among the highest in the G20. Mexico was struggling before the pandemic and seems ill-positioned to cope with the coming economic shock. The dollar is at record highs against the peso, reaching almost MXN24.65 before the weekend. The rise has been breath-taking: 11.4% last week after 9% the previous week. In the five-week advance, the greenback has risen from about MXN18.54 on February 24 to settle a little below MXN24.42 before the weekend, an almost 32% move (31.7%). Chinese Yuan: The dollar had been relatively stable against the Chinese yuan from the time the local markets re-opened from their extended Lunar New Year holiday on February 3. It was confined to a CNY6.91-CNY7.05 trading range. The broad dollar buying pressure was too great, and it gapped higher on March 19 to trade near CNY7.1250 and held the breakout on March 20. The dollar reached a high around CNY7.1850 last September, though the CNY7.15 area may prove a bit sticky first. The yuan lost about 1.2% against the dollar last week but gained against near every other currency in the world. This appreciation may have prompted officials to allow a weaker yuan in the previous couple of sessions. However, the fix has been stronger yuan than the bank models suggested in recent days. Gold: The price of gold has dropped 15% since March 9, high above $1700. Some gold sales were linked to the need to raise cash (in part to meet margin calls elsewhere). Other links include some participants borrowed dollars to buy gold, and as the structure was unwound, gold, which was treated like any other asset, was liquidated. There was an attempt to form a base near $1450 last week. Both the MACD and Slow Stochastic have flattened out but have yet to turn higher. A close back above the 200-day moving average (~$1503) would help the tone. If a near-term bottom is in place, then the first corrective targets are seen near $1544 and $1575. Oil: May crude reached nearly $20 a barrel in the middle of last week, an 18-year low. At the end of 1998 is briefly traded below $10.50. Although the MACD and Slow Stochastic are overextended and the $20 level was tested again ahead of the weekend, there is no compelling technical sign a low is in place. The lower Bollinger Band is a little below $18. Initial resistance is seen near $30 and then $36.35. Ahead of the weekend, Saudi Arabia and Iraq reduced discounts for shipments (which is tantamount to a price increase), and Aramco's (SE:2222) CEO warned that it may not be able to maintain maximum output beyond April. Over the past two weeks, U.S. crude inventories have risen about 9.5 mln barrels. Meanwhile, as the first step toward implementing Trump's call for the to top up the Strategic Petroleum Reserves (available capacity of another 77 mln barrels), the Department of Energy said it would buy 30 mln barrels by the end of June (~11.3 mln barrels of sweet crude and ~18.7 mln barrels of sour crude). It will focus, according to official statements, on purchases from small and medium-sized producers (with less than 5k employees). U.S. Yields: The largest and most liquid and transparent bond market, U.S. Treasuries, has been destabilized. Consider the ranges of the generic 10-year yield. In the first week of March, the range was a little more than 50 bp. In the second week of March, the range was 70 bp, and last week's range was 65 bp. The March 9 low was about 31 bp, and last week's high (March 19) was 1.27%. The yield pulled back to 84 bp ahead of the weekend. At 137-06, the June note futures retraced half of its losses since the March 9 high (140-24). The next (61.8%) retracement is near 138. The two-yield fell for the fifth consecutive week. On Valentine's Day, it closed just shy of 1.43% and finished last week a touch above 31 bp. The first fed funds futures contract that ended last week above 25 bp was July 2022, though illiquidity may distort. The June Eurodollar Futures contract implies a three-month yield in three months of a little less than 55 bp. The next quarterly contract that implies a higher yield than that is December 2022. S&P 500: The benchmark has not strung together two consecutive gains in over a month. It finished last week below the initial (38.2%) retracement of the rally since the 2009 low that is found near 2352. The next retracement (50%) is seen near 2030. The Slow Stochastic is moving sideways in over-extended territory, while the MACD appears to be at record lows and still heading south. The VIX peaked in the middle of the week above 85, more than four-times the six-month average. It traded below 60 ahead of the weekend before rebounding to close above 66. The higher vol is translated into wider Bollinger Bands, which are set at two standard deviations from the 20-day moving average. The S&P 500 finished the week above the lower Bollinger Band (~2230).

5e5d07dc2e1fe5553d2b638a	Strong U.S. Economic Data Weighs on Aussie, Kiwi & Yen	Better-than-expected economic data drove the U.S. Dollar higher last week against the Australian and New Zealand Dollars, and the Japanese Yen. The dollar was boosted by better-than-expected U.S. economic data. Optimism over improving global economic growth with the signing of the trade deal between the United States and China also underpinned the greenback. The Aussie and Kiwi were also underpinned by the inking of the trade deal, but domestic economic concerns limited gains as well as increasing chances of central bank rate cuts. Demand for higher-yielding assets drove the Japanese Yen lower. President Trump signed a “phase one” trade agreement with China as the world’s two biggest economies try to rein in a more than 18-month trade war. The deal includes provisions to root out intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers and increase Chinese purchases of U.S. goods, though it leaves open questions about enforcement. Additionally, the Trump administration aims to start negotiating the next piece of the trade agreement before the November 2020 election. Consumer prices rose slightly less than expected in December and monthly underlying inflation pressures retreated, which could allow the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged throughout this year. The U.S. Labor Department also reported its producer price index for final demand ticked up 0.1% last month after being unchanged in November. Weekly jobless claims unexpectedly dropped by 10,000 to 204,000. Economists polled by Reuters expected a print of 216,000. Meanwhile, retail sales climbed by 0.3% in December, matching expectations. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve business index also jumped to 17 in January from 2.4 in December. Finally, U.S. housing starts soared nearly 17% in December to a 13-year high, according to a Friday release from the Census Bureau. There were no major economic releases in Australia last week, but traders continued to express concerns over the impact of the massive bushfires on the economy. Because of the damage to the economy especially the tourism industry, some traders are starting to price in a rate cut by the Reserve Bank in February. The Aussie was also influenced by economic news from China. China’s dollar-denominated imports from the U.S. rebounded in November and December, Reuters reported citing data from China’s customs released on January 14. It was the first time that its exports went up since March last year. In December China’s trade surplus with the U.S. was $23.18 billion – down from $24.6 billion in November. China’s GDP numbers which came in on Friday largely met analyst expectations. It announced its economy grew by 6.1% in 2019, meeting expectations even amid a trade dispute with the U.S. Its GDP grew 6.0% on-year in the fourth quarter of 2019. That’s unchanged from the pace in the third quarter, which was believed to be its slowest GDP gain in at least 27 ½ years. The AUD/USD finished the week at .6872, down 0.0028 or -0.40%. New Zealand business sentiment improved starkly in the last three months of 2019 from the decade-low hit the previous quarter, a private think tank said on Tuesday. A net 21% of firms surveyed expected general business conditions to deteriorate compared with 40% – the worst reading since March 2009 – in the previous quarter, the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research’s (NZIER) quarterly survey of business opinion (QSBO) showed. The NZD/USD settled at .6611, down 0.0025 or -0.37%. The Japanese Yen hit a multi-month low last week, fueled by increased demand for higher-yielding assets, which made the safe-haven currency a less-desirable investment. Better-than-expected U.S. economic data also drive U.S. interest rates higher, widening the spread between U.S. Government bond and Japanese Government bond yields. The Bank of Japan was in the news last week ahead of this week’s BOJ interest rate and policy decisions The Bank of Japan cut its economic assessment for three of the country’s nine regions on Wednesday but remained cautiously optimistic that domestic demand could help offset a slowdown in exports and manufacturing. Also on Wednesday, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda held to the BOJ’s view that the Japanese economy will see moderate growth despite weak exports and output, hit by the global slowdown and natural disasters at home. On Thursday, Reuters reported the Bank of Japan is expected to keep monetary policy steady this week and nudge up its economic growth forecast, as the U.S.-China trade deal and de-escalation in Middle East tensions take some pressure off the central bank for more stimulus. Last week, the USD/JPY settled at 110.170, up 0.663 or +0.61%	JPY
5e81b5e9c496d2354de73024	Dollar Falls as Soft Data and Trade Hope and Brexit Guide Markets	The US dollar is lower against most major pairs on Friday. The greenback was higher on Thursday as investors sought refuge after the Brexit drama and the apparent delay in the US-China negotiation. President Trump later said that news is upcoming in the next 3-4 weeks, once again boosting optimism that the two largest economies will reach a deal. News of a delay have now been digested, but the praise from Trump on the negotiations brought back risk appetite to investors who sold the US dollar. The wires were also full of hope on an extension being granted by the EU on the Brexit deadline. There are still a lot of work to do to move parliament from its current fragmented form into a consensus that approves a workable deal. Brexit Drama to Continue as BOE Shares the Stage The GBP/USD rose 2.09 percent in the last five trading days. The pound is higher against the greenback after the UK parliament voted to seek an extension of the Article 50 deadline. There was plenty of volatility during the week as the UK parliament voted on British Prime Minister Theresa May’s proposal, a no-deal exit and other amendments which included the extension. May was once again defeated, but lawmakers voted for a no-deal divorce boosting the pound. Near the end of the week the extension vote was victorious but with the caveat that it needs to be ratified by all 27 EU members. Theresa May will try once again to get her proposal to pass on the same week the Bank of England (BoE) is scheduled to warn investors about the dangers of a no-deal exit, that although has been voted in parliament is dependent on an agreement being made to fully rule out the possibility of that scenario becoming a reality. A defeat on her third attempt could mean the UK would need a longer extension and even a second referendum is back on the table at that point. British economic indicators to watch out for during the week include the jobs report, inflation and retail sales. GOLD Gold rose 0.51 percent on Friday. The yellow metal climbed above the $1,300 price level but remains in a consolidation pattern. The softness of the dollar after disappointing economic indicators and lack of demand for the greenback as a safe haven appreciated the value of gold. Gold will remain on the mind of investors ahead of a busy week. The U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England (BoE) will hold court, along with a plethora of economic indicator releases and to top it off the UK parliament could hold a Brexit vote on March 19. OIL Oil fell on Friday after hitting a 2019 high. The fragile balance between the OPEC+ crude output limit and the rising production in the US is easily disrupted. Higher oil production and question marks about global demand won out at the end of the week with crude prices retreating. The ongoing OPEC+ agreement could be extended which is why prices could be higher in the second quarter to the year as the production cap soaks up excess capacity, even with a big push from US producers. Sanctions against Iranian and Venezuelan crude exports could accelerate the upward trajectory given that global demand for energy appears steady at current prices. OPEC compliance has been high, but it remains to be seen if all members in particular the leaders Saudi Arabia and Russia are willing to keep limiting their revenue beyond April. STOCKS Global stocks rose on Friday after news that China is ready to keep adding stimulus to its economy looking to regain its growth momentum.

5e5d0926bd5d9d5ac0727656	US Dollar, USD/SGD, USD/IDR May Rise on FOMC Minutes and Repos	The US Dollar had a mixed week against its major counterparts while seeing cautious upside progress against some of its ASEAN counterparts. The Singapore Dollar fared the worst, as expected, in the aftermath of dovish commentary from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Against the Philippine Peso, the Greenback underperformed but USD/PHP largely remained in its persistent consolidation mode. The Peso could thank a sovereign credit rating upgrade to positive from stable via Fitch. The Malaysian Ringgit weakened following worse-than-expected GDP data, but ended the week close to little changed. What was perhaps the most surprising is why USD/SGD, USD/MYR, USD/IDR and USD/PHP failed to fully capitalize on another week of upbeat market mood. These tend to inversely follow sentiment. For timely updates on ASEAN currencies, make sure to follow me on Twitter here @ddubrovskyFX Financial markets largely brushed off a sudden surge in coronavirus cases after China revised the method of counting total reports. The world’s second-largest economy is a key trading partner for the ASEAN nations, and its economy is expected to slow. Singapore reported a 25-30% decline in tourists this year due to concerns about the Wuhan virus. In fact, the US Dollar has generally been rising this month despite gains in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (EEM). Its ascent appears to be supported by aggressive declines in the Euro, the world’s second-most-liquid currency next to the Dollar. Around the time when the EEM started rising, the Euro began depreciating against a basked of its major counterparts. That may be what is keeping the haven-linked Greenback elevated. Chart Created in TradingView Focusing on regional event risk for ASEAN currencies, Tuesday will bring Singapore’s fiscal 2020 budget statement. The country’s budget deficit is expected to rise, indicating an expansionary policy. This comes despite the US-China “phase-one” trade deal and the outbreak of the coronavirus. A larger-than-expected deficit may undermine the case for MAS dovishness, perhaps boosting the Singapore Dollar. On Thursday, the Bank of Indonesia will deliver its interest rate announcement. According to Bloomberg, odds of a 25-bp rate cut are just above 50% which would leave around half of traders on the wrong end of the outcome. That is a natural ingredient for potential volatility in the Indonesian Rupiah and USD/IDR. Friday will bring Malaysia’s latest CPI report where inflation is expected to clock in at 1.8% y/y in January. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stressed this past week that the current policy stance remains appropriate. This is in stark contrast with market expectations which are fully baking in expectations of one 25-bp rate cut by the end of this year. Odds of a further reduction are around 50%. If this week’s FOMC meeting minutes uphold a neutral bias, that may fuel risk aversion and send the US Dollar higher. Keep in mind that the central bank reiterated on its plan to slowly trim repo operations in the weeks ahead which would gradually reduce liquidity. That is another fundamental risk for equities and if growth in the balance sheet slows, we may see USD/SGD, USD/IDR, USD/PHP and USD/MYR aim higher. U.S. data has also been tending to outperform relative to economists’ expectations. More of the same may boost the USD. -- Written by Daniel Dubrovsky, Currency Analyst for DailyFX.com To contact Daniel, use the comments section below or @ddubrovskyFX on Twitter	SGD
5e5d9a1c069471014b3e9078	Chinese stocks surge beyond 3% despite factory activity plunging below expectations	Stocks in Asia mostly rose on Tuesday, though gains were capped amid potentially dashed hopes that central banks could take action to combat the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Mainland Chinese stocks rose on the day, with the Shenzhen component up 0.9% to 11,484.21 while the Shenzhen composite gained 1.031% to about 1,888.92. Earlier in the session, the Shenzhen indexes had seen gains of more than 2% each. The Shanghai composite advanced 0.74% to around 2,992.90. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was about 0.3% higher, as of its final hour of trading. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.58% to close at 2,014.15. Elsewhere, however, the Nikkei 225 in Japan slipped 1.22% to close at 21,082.73 while the Topix declined 1.36% to end its trading day at 1,505.12. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 closed 0.69% higher at 6,435.70. Overall, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index was 0.84% higher. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announced on Tuesday a cut in the cash rate by 25 basis points to 0.5%, a new record low. Following that decision, the Australian dollar jumped to $0.6549 after seeing an earlier low of $0.6507. “The coronavirus outbreak overseas is having a significant effect on the Australian economy at present, particularly in the education and travel sectors,” said RBA Governor Philip Lowe in a statement. “The global outbreak of the coronavirus is expected to delay progress in Australia towards full employment and the inflation target. The Board therefore judged that it was appropriate to ease monetary policy further to provide additional support to employment and economic activity,” Lowe said. Commenting after the RBA announced its decision, HSBC’s Paul Bloxham said that the central bank “moved so fast.” “I’m not sure the monetary (policy) response is going to do that much but it’s obviously ... the RBA sensed that they kinda had to do this,” Bloxham, who is chief economist for Australia, New Zealand and global commodities at HSBC, told CNBC’s “Street Signs” on Thursday. “The key question is gonna be, looking globally, is this the lead off for a lot of other central banks to follow suit?,” he asked. “The RBA is leading the way in terms of ... delivering a cut. I don’t know how effective it’s going to be.” Over in Malaysia, where the country was hit by a recent wave of political uncertainty that resulted in the unexpected appointment of a new prime minister, Bank Negara Malaysia cut its overnight policy rate by 25 basis points to 2.5%. That was the lowest in 10 years, according to Reuters. The narrowing of gains regionally came following a Tuesday Reuters report that the Group of Seven industrial powers is expected to issue a statement on Tuesday or Wednesday on countering the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. At present, that did not include any specific call for new government expenditure or coordinated interest rate cuts by central banks, Reuters reported citing a G-7 official with direct knowledge of the deliberations. That came as investors awaited a conference call between global financial ministers and central bankers to coordinate the financial and economic response to the coronavirus. The teleconference call will be led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and is expected to happen on Tuesday at 7 a.m. ET, according to CNBC’s Steve Liesman. Representatives of the Group of Seven industrialized nations will attend the call. “I think the fact that we’re even getting the conversation about stimulus is a positive,” said Manpreet Gill, head of fixed income, currencies and commodities investment strategy at Standard Chartered Private Bank. Sill, Gill added that traditional monetary policy is a “blunt instrument.” “You’re gonna get more liquidity, you can get lower interest rates. That may be part of a good solution but that may not be enough in itself,” he told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Tuesday. Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 1,293.96 points higher to close at 26,703.32 — its biggest move on a percentage basis since March 2009 and the 30-stock average’s largest-ever points gain. The S&P 500 jumped 4.6% — its best one-day performance since Dec. 26, 2018 — to end its trading day at 3,090.23. The Nasdaq Composite also had its best day since 2018, surging 4.5% to close at 8,952.16. Investors were driven to safety last week amid fears over the economic impact of the coronavirus spreading rapidly outside of China, where the disease was first reported. More than 89,000 cases have been confirmed around the world so far along with at least 3,000 virus-related deaths. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was last at 97.444 after declining from levels around around 98 yesterday. The Japanese yen strengthened to 107.93 per dollar after an earlier low of 108.53. Oil prices were higher in the afternoon of Asian trading hours, with international benchmark Brent crude futures up 0.92% to $52.38 per barrel while U.S. crude futures advanced 1.43% to $47.42 per barrel. — CNBC’s Fred Imbert contributed to this report.

5e5d086673d82f5acc8afc68	Four Stocks to Watch as the Race for a Coronavirus Vaccine Picks Up	"The rapid spread of coronavirus and the potential for global economic disruption led to the worst day for US stocks in two years yesterday. Though the human and financial cost of the virus is massive and growing, every crisis presents opportunities for savvy traders. For example, the likelihood of disruptions to business travel schedules stemming from COVID-19 has prompted traders to bid up the stock of Zoom Communications (ZM), a remote video conferencing platform, to record highs; in fact, the stock is up an incredible 59% so far this year alone! One more direct way to speculate on potential beneficiaries of coronavirus’s spread is through the pharmaceutical companies seeking to develop vaccines and treatments for the virus: GILD and JNJ: Potential Opportunity in Two Healthcare Stalwarts More conservative investors may want to watch the stocks of large, profitable companies doing research into potential vaccines such as Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Johnson and Johnson (JNJ). For its part, Gilead has caught a bid after a World Health Organization (WHO) official stated that “There is only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy and that's Remdesivir,"" referring to Gilead’s experimental drug that was also used to treat Ebola. GILD has been able to shrug off the broader market’s headwinds to close at its highest level since 2018, and positive results from expanded trials of Remdesivir may boost the stock further in the coming weeks. Meanwhile the Janssen Pharmaceutical division of Johnson and Johnson, another healthcare stalwart, has a strong track record of quickly developing vaccines for epidemics and began working on a vaccine for COVID-19 weeks ago. While it may be a step behind Gilead in developing a potential breakthrough drug, it’s hard to bet against Johnson and Johnson’s team. JNJ has pulled back to test its 50-day EMA along with the broader market, presenting a potential opportunity to buy the stock at a discount for bullish traders. Source: TradingView, GAIN Capital MRNA and REGN: Higher Volatility Plays for More Aggressive Traders Of course, with market capitalizations in the $100-400B range, even a breakthrough treatment for COVID-19 may not move the stocks of GILD and JNJ as much as aggressive traders would hope (it’s also worth noting that those stocks would likely remain profitable from their other business lines regardless). Instead, more aggressive traders may prefer to keep an eye on smaller capitalization stocks like Moderna (MRNA) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN). Recently, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) agreed to fund Moderna to create a vaccine for coronavirus after seeing its strong results from a Phase 1 vaccine trial. Looking at the stock, MRNA has gapped higher today and is trading roughly in the middle of its 3-month range between $18 and $24. A break above $24.00 could mark the start of another leg higher. Finally, Regeneron has tested two of its drugs, REGN3048 and REGN3051, on similar diseases in mice and saw a substantial decline in viral loads in the lungs. The company is currently experimenting with a combination of drugs “designed with the goal of enhancing efficacy, reducing the development of viral sequences that lead to resistance, and increasing potential utility in future outbreaks as viruses continually evolve.” Whether any of these drugs prove to be effective remains to be seen, but traders aren’t waiting for results: REGN has already rallied 33% this month alone, but given it’s $50B market cap, it could still gain more ground if its drugs are found to be effective. Source: TradingView, GAIN Capital There are no doubt countless other companies seeking a breakthrough to help the afflicted (and their own shareholders), but based on our read of the current situation, GILD, JNJ, MRNA, and REGN may offer some of the best opportunities for traders hunting for a cure."

5e5d587936af384488d3b2ef	If Central Banks Are Cutting Rates, Someone Forgot To Tell USD/CHF	With the coronavirus running amuck causing fears of a stalled world economy for Q1 and possibly even Q2, there has been talk of possible rate cuts by central banks around the globe, including the Federal Reserve. Although many have questioned how this will help people get back on planes and cruise ships, stock markets are taking this as a positive signal. Over the last 10 years or so, bad news is good, as the Fed has been there as a backstop to falling stock markets. If talk of central banks cutting rates is positive, someone forgot to tell USD/CHF, as the flight to safety seems to be in full effect. Granted, Manufacturing PMI for Feb from Switzerland did come out to better at 49.5 vs. 48.1 expected and 47.8 last, however the PMIs are not the driver of markets these days. The Swiss Franc has always been a flight to safety currency and as a result, it is still going bid (USD/CHF lower). On the daily timeframe, USD/CHF moved lower in December to the target of the double top near .9662. Price then traded sideways through January, before bouncing to resistance and the neckline of the double top and the 200-day moving average near .9850. As stocks sold off in mid-February, so too did USD/CHF, as traders sought to move out of stocks and into the Swiss Franc. The pair currently is trading near horizontal support at .9550, which is the September 18, 2019 lows. Bulls may be looking to buy near here, with stops below the September lows. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com On a 240-minute timeframe, the lows also coincide with the 127.2% extension from the low in early February to the highs at .9850. The RSI is diverging slightly, which may allow the pair to stay around there as the RSI winds. Horizontal resistance near .9615/30. Bears will look to sell bounce near this level. Support is at the 161.8% Fibonacci extension from the same time period, near .9430, which is also within a band of support on the daily timeframe. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Whether or not central banks decide to cut rates in response to a slowdown from the coronavirus, it still seems as if not all market participants think it will help. We are still seeing the flight to safety trade in USD/CHF.	CHF
5e8b93d3084c294a43ff0a3e	RBA Interest Rate Decision should be Quiet Event	During the upcoming Asian session, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will be holding its regularly scheduled Interest Rate Decision meeting. However, there is unlikely to be any fireworks from the meeting or the accompanying statement. On March 3rd, the RBA was expected to leave rates on hold as the coronavirus was just beginning to spread its way out of China. However, the Bank cut rates from 0.75% to 0.50%. Less than 2 weeks later, on March 19th, the RBA slashed rates to 0.25% to combat negative economic effects from the coronavirus. The Board said they would not increase the rate until progress is made in employment and they feel inflation will be with in 2-3% target. In addition, Australia began their own Quantitative Easing program and will continue to provide liquidity via repo operations until further notice. On the day the RBA cut to 0.25%, the AUD/USD reached its lowest point since October 2002, near .5500. It has since bounced near the 61.8% retracement level from the March 9th highs to the March 19th lows just above .6200. There is horizontal resistance bear that area as well. .6200/.6235 will be resistance area for price. There are horizontal resistance areas above at .6314 and .6433. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com On a 240-minute timeframe, AUD/USD moved lower out of a rising wedge formation. First horizontal support is just under .6000 at today’s low near .5980. Horizontal support is just under that near .5950. There is one more area I would consider horizontal support near .5840, before there is room for the pair to test the lows near .5500. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com AUD/USD closed over +1.5% today. It seems as if each day traders cling to news of whether the new number of coronavirus cases was higher or lower than the previous day. Over the course of the last 2 days, traders are taking the data as “positive”, hence the S&P 500 was up nearly 7% today. This also helped push AUD/USD higher. The RBA will mostly likely try and “stay the course” until they get more evidence of a global decline in infections before they do anything to interest rates.	AUD
5e9450b15688d506d75f71f7	EUR/USD will decide on direction	On Monday morning, the major currency pair is barely moving: a lot of investors from the Catholic world have been rather inactive since last Friday due to the Easter holidays, that’s why today’s economic calendar is almost empty. When the market is calm and there is no news, it’s high time to learn different opinions and predictions for the future. For example, the CBA (Commonwealth Bank of Australia) attracted attention by saying that it might make sense to buy the Euro against the USD with the target at 1.16. The argument is that effective economic policies and measures taken by the Eurozone will provide the financial stability of the region. Indeed, last week, finance ministers on the Eurozone agreed on a new tool to support the region, the ESM, which is an extended credit line for the alliance members. The countries that suffered most from the coronavirus pandemic and its consequences will get access to a huge amount of liquidity. The ESM will be an additional measure to already existing support mechanisms and the combined effect will help the Eurozone to recover rather quickly. Such a strategy really looks very promising, but it’s better to wait for the first results. In the H4 chart, after returning to 1.0940, EUR/USD is consolidating at the top of this ascending wave. After breaking the rising channel’s downside border, the pair may form a new descending wave with the first target at 1.0888. Later, the market may start another growth to reach 1.0920 and then resume trading inside the downtrend. From the technical point of view, this scenario is confirmed by MACD Oscillator: its signal line is moving outside the histogram area but still above 0. If the line breaks 0 to the downside, the pair may boost its decline on the price chart. As we can see in the H1 chart, the pair has completed the rising wave towards 1.0966, thus finishing the current uptrend. According to the main scenario, EUR/USD is expected to fall to reach 1.0920. Later, the market may form one more ascending structure towards 1.0940 and then return to 1.0920. After breaking this level downwards, the instrument may continue falling with the target at 1.0888. From the technical point of view, this scenario is confirmed by Stochastic Oscillator: its signal line has rebounded from 50 to the downside, thus indicating another decline towards 20.	EUR
5e5d083673d82f5acc8afc58	NZD/USD Bulls are Salivating	Earlier today, New Zealand was the latest to fall victim to the coronavirus. A woman in her 60s who traveled from Iran to Auckland via Bali tested positive for the virus on Friday. NZD/USD is down 1.1% today and gunning for it’s the October 1st lows near .6200. The lows of 2015 are .6193 as well. From a trading point of view, NZD/USD bulls will be looking to buy near this levels and place stops below the 2015 lows. Why? Because there is tremendous Risk/Reward potential. If one buys near .6230, and risks 50 pips, this trader may look for a target of .6430 (or more), or the 38.2% retracement from the December 31st highs to today’s lows. That’s a risk/reward of 1:4, that is, risking 50 to make 200. Bulls may look to take advantage of the risk/reward near the lows. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com On a shorter 240-minute timeframe, let’s say a trader wishes to risk less. This trader must be patient and wait for the market to “come to them” near the .6200 level. For example, this trader only wants to risk 20 pips. He or she may wait and buy at .6205 and place stops below the 2015 lows at .6185. Horizontal resistance appears to be at .6284. So, if this trader places a take profit order at .6275 (or more), they risk/reward would be 1:3.5, that is, risking 20 to make 75. The RSI is diverging with price, however in this hyper volatile market oscillators should not be used alone (or even at all). But again, bulls may look to take advantage of the risk/reward near the lows. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Whether one is bullish or bearish, each trader has their own risk tolerances. That is something each trader must decide for himself or herself. Sometimes, when things look to be at the worst, they may turn out to be the best. As long as traders use proper risk management (NZD/USD bulls in this case), trades can have large upside potential, or minimal loss. In this case, bulls may be looking for support near the lows to try and make that happen.	NZD
5e78fcc9123ae01617b126e7	Dow Jones Price Outlook: Boeing to Undermine Index Further, Support Eyed	The Dow Jones opened lower to start the week despite another unexpected announcement from the Federal Reserve in which they revealed opened-ended purchases of mortgage-backed securities and treasuries. The policy is intended to help smooth market functioning, but traders were seemingly unconvinced it was enough to completely ward off further losses. Consequently, it seems equity traders will rely on coronavirus news for price influence. Encouragingly, Italy witnessed a decrease in hospitalized patients in Lombardy and a slowing trend of new coronavirus cases in Milan. Together, the developments may have contributed to the intraday bump the Dow Jones enjoyed. Nevertheless, the Industrial Average remains threatened – even when compared to its Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 counterparts. Amid the ongoing containment measures, Boeing announced it would close its Puget Sound factories for at least two weeks which saw BA shares halted in mid-day trading. Despite the pause in trading, the news is yet another negative development for the airliner manufacturer, adding to a string of issues that has seen it fall down the order of Dow components. The precipitous decline in Boeing’s stock price has – among other factors - seen the Industrial Average fall farther than the S&P 500 and even the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 during the current stock market crash. In turn, the DJIA is well beneath the levels that are currently aiding the other two indices and has left it grasping for subsequent support around 18,000. The area coincides with various highs in 2015 but may only offer a modicum of support given the pace of declines. S&P 500, DAX 30, ASX 200 Forecasts for the Week Ahead Therefore, secondary and tertiary support around 16,000 and 15,300 may come into play should declines continue. While I noted a modest decline in the VIX last Friday, Monday’s trading has seen volatility revive and threaten to deliver the drastic price swings stocks have seen over the last month. To be sure, equity declines may persist until volatility cools and the pace of gains and losses slows. In the meantime, keep an eye on volatility and sign up for my webinar below for an extended analysis of equity markets in the week ahead. --Written by Peter Hanks, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com Contact and follow Peter on Twitter @PeterHanksFX	USD
5e81b629c496d2354de7305e	Powell’s toughest FOMC meeting	Jerome H. Powell took office and began his four-year term as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on February 5, 2018. He has delivered three rate increases since taking the lead post and has continued unwinding the Fed’s balance sheet. Since the November meeting, the US economy has still generated good, albeit softer data, but the risks to the economy have grown. This by far will be his most difficult decision as the Fed has been very clear in signaling a December hike is coming and market expectations are for him to lower the dot plot forecast. Neutral Mistake On October 3rd, Powell said that the Fed “may go past neutral. But we’re a long way from neutral at this point.” That comment ended the bull market run with US equities. Powell’s pivot eventually occurred at the NY Economic Club on November 28th. He stated that interest rates are “just below” a range of estimates of the so-called neutral level. Equities rebounded as Powell appeared to have taken his foot off the interest rate accelerator. Equities however resumed their bearish correction as slower growth globally and concerns of the shrinking balance sheet could pull liquidity from money markets during a weakening economy. Interest Rate Decision The probability that the Fed will raise the funds target range by 25 basis points, is no longer a slam dunk. At the end of Tuesday, expectations hovered around two-thirds, well off the 80% certainty we saw at the end of November. They will probably deliver a rate hike, but if they didn’t, we should not be surprised. The Fed historically does not like to raise rates during extreme periods of market turmoil. Another option for the Fed would be to say that rates are at neutral, however this unlikely to happen. Dot Plot Expectations The September FOMC Economic Projections targeted three hikes in 2019 and two in 2020. The market is widely expecting them to reduce the forecast in 2019 to only two hikes, with some analysts’ expecting one hike. The Fed could also cut the outlook for 2020 and 2021. The market is highly pricing in a dovish hike and it is unlikely that it will be as dovish as expected. Balance Sheet The Fed began shrinking its balance with Janet Yellen back in October of 2017. It has been lowered from around $4.51 trillion to $4.14 trillion. The current tightening schedule has been removing $50 billion of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities holdings on a monthly basis. We have not heard of a specific target from the Fed, but Powell did state during his confirmation hearing last year the balance sheet could target $2.5 to $3 trillion. Most analysts currently see the balance sheet settling between $3.5-$3.8 trillion. The Fed may provide some clarity on economist concerns of the effects of pulling liquidity from a softening economy. Trump & Central Bank Independence President Trump has been very vocal on discouraging the Fed from raising interest rates. However, his comments may actual drive the Fed to actual raise rates to assert its independence. This week the President has tweeted the following: “I hope the people over at the Fed will read today’s Wall Street Journal Editorial before they make yet another mistake. Also, don’t let the market become any more illiquid than it already is. Stop with the 50 B’s. Feel the market, don’t just go by meaningless numbers. Good luck!” It is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, Paris is burning and China way down, the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike. Take the Victory! What could we expect? A dovish hike is firmly expected since the outlook is weaker and market sentiment is deeply negative. The Fed is also expected to remove the statement that “further gradual increases” in rates are likely to be required. The Fed’s dot plots should come down, with 2019 falling from three hikes to two. The 2020 and 2021 dots could also come down with the longer run outlook also falling. The Fed is likely to emphasize being data dependent. The US dollar will likely react to how much the forecasts change. If the Fed does not provide any major downgrades to the dots and highlights the strong labor market, rising wages, and inflation near their target, the dollar could climb higher. If the Fed is successful in providing a clear dovish tone with lower projections, we could see high-beta currencies rally. Oil’s Sell-off Accelerates The fundamentals for oil remain very bearish. One day oil is lower on global growth concerns, the next day it falls on supply worries, and sometimes it drops on a risk off trading day. US West Texas Intermediate crude is now at 15-month lows after falling below the $50 a barrel level. OPEC and allies have now seen their production cut completely wiped out. The $42 level remains major support for oil. Canada’s inflation data in focus Inflation expectations for the November readings are expected to decline. The annual reading is expected to fall from 2.4% to 1.8% and the monthly reading from 0.3% to -0.4%. The Bank of Canada has already warned that rate hikes could be interrupted and if we see inflation fall below the 2% target, that could help keep BOC on hold.

5e8503b49fd2a93b395a4747	U.S. dollar gains as global recession looms	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar advanced on Wednesday, with markets bracing for what is shaping up to be one of the worst economic contractions in decades as the world confronts the coronavirus pandemic. The greenback, the world’s leading global reserve currency, rose against the euro, sterling and most other major currencies as selling in global shares highlighted growing risks from the pandemic that has shown little sign of easing. “The dollar does well in global recessions,” said Momtchil Pojarliev, head of currencies at BNP Asset Management in New York. “We think this virus is going to cause a global recession so the dollar will do well.” Markets were spooked after U.S. President Donald Trump’s dire press briefing late Tuesday, where he warned Americans of a “painful” two weeks ahead in fighting the coronavirus even with strict social distancing measures. White House coronavirus coordinator Deborah Birx displayed charts demonstrating data and modeling that showed an enormous jump in deaths to a range of 100,000 to 240,000 people from the virus in the coming months. In afternoon trading, the U.S. dollar index was up 0.5% at 99.528 =USD. Analysts said coordinated action by central banks to boost dollar supply has helped calm extreme volatility, but money markets still need time to settle. U.S. data showing private sector jobs lost for the month of March were much lower than expected, did not really change sentiment, as the survey was conducted in mid-March and did not capture the full impact of the coronavirus. The ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed private payrolls fell by 27,000 jobs last month, the first decline since September 2017, compared with forecasts of 150,000 job losses. Another piece of data showed that U.S. manufacturing activity contracted less than expected in March, but disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic pushed new orders received by factories to an 11-year low, reinforcing economists’ views that the economy was in recession. Artur Baluszynski, head of research at Henderson Rowe, said he expects the new orders’ index to start feeding through to the main index next month. “With almost every segment of the global economy shutting down one after another, first due to supply and now due to demand shocks, these numbers will get worse and worse,” he added. The euro, meanwhile, fell 0.8% against the dollar, dropping to $1.0947 EUR=EBS. A slew of currencies - including the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars, along with the South African rand - were down around 1% versus the greenback AUD=D3 NZD=D3 CAD= ZAR=. Sterling fared slightly better, last little changed at $1.2405. GBP=D3. Against the safe-haven yen, however, the dollar was down 0.4% at 107.12 yen JPY=EBS. But yen strength may not last long as Japan is also reeling from the crisis.

5e8612a2de45e95f5a0d4254	Dollar Firm Despite US Jobless Claims Carnage	"The eagerly awaited U.S. jobless claims figure came in at 6.6 million for the week ending March 28, missing analyst expectations of 3.5 million and rising from 3.3 million in the prior week. The record-breaking figure underscored the extent of the damage caused to the U.S. economy by the coronavirus pandemic. Reactions from the world’s leading economic minds highlighted the severe implications of the latest jobless claims release. Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Allianz (DE:ALVG) tweeted: ‘6.648 million! Another huge jump in US weekly jobless claims. Another indication of the virus’s devastating immediate and longer-term effects on social/economic/financial well being. Also serves as a reminder of the difficulties of aligning collective/individual corporate interests.’ Nobel laureate Paul Krugman gave some perspective of the figure as it relates to the 2008 crisis, tweeting: ""10 million new claims for unemployment insurance over 2 weeks. That’s around 20 times the normal rate, and understates actual job losses. For comparison, 9 million jobs lost in the Great Recession."" U.S. stock index futures and USD/JPY traded lower in the initial reaction to the release before rebounding. Equity markets and USD/JPY weakened on Wednesday following President Donald Trump’s unsettling press conference late on Tuesday. Investors were rattled after Trump warned Americans to prepare for a “very, very painful two weeks.” The White House also projected that the coronavirus pandemic could claim 100,000 to 240,000 lives, even if social distancing precautions are followed. U.S. stock index futures were boosted early on Thursday by a jump in oil prices. Crude oil, a proxy for global economic prospects, jumped after Trump said he expects Saudi Arabia and Russia to reach an agreement over their price war. The rebound comes after WTI crude oil prices fell to the lowest levels in 18 years on March 30th. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that coronavirus COVID-19 global cases have risen to 951,901, with 48,320 fatalities. The death toll in Spain passed 10,000 on Thursday, after both the United Kingdom and the United States reported their highest number of deaths in a single day on Wednesday. While there are indications that infections in Italy may be slowing, cases are still rising in many countries, including the United States. Investors now look to Friday’s U.S. employment report. Analysts are expecting a drop of just 100,000 in nonfarm payrolls, but this is because the data only runs up to March 12th."	USD
5e85120a1838927e42a922e3	‘Shutdown everywhere’ for at least 10 weeks? Bill Gates warns there’s ‘no middle ground’ in the coronavirus fight	‘Shutdown anywhere means shutdown everywhere.’ That’s Microsoft MSFT, -0.10% founder Bill Gates urging the government to enforce a nationwide shutdown in an op-ed in the Washington Post this week. “Despite urging from public health experts, some states and counties haven’t shut down completely,” he said. “In some states, beaches are still open; in others, restaurants still serve sit-down meals. This is a recipe for disaster. Because people can travel freely across state lines, so can the virus.” He explained that until the numbers start to go down across the country — which he says could take at least 10 weeks — the shutdown should be in play everywhere. He also stepped up his call for more testing and was hopeful a vaccine will be developed in less than 18 months. As it stands now, at least 30 states have stay-at-home orders in place with some 250 million Americans told to remain sheltered and maintain social-distancing measures. Dispatches from a pandemic:‘Would you risk your life for a bagel?’ A New Yorker’s 5-point guide to surviving grocery stores during the coronavirus pandemic Gates’s latest comments echo those made in a recent TED interview. ‘There really is no middle ground, and it’s very tough to say to people, “Hey, keep going to restaurants, go buy new houses, [and] ignore that pile of bodies over in the corner,’” he said, taking aim at politicians who seem to think GDP growth is all that counts. The Gates Foundation ponied up $100 million to assist in the battle against the spread of coronavirus in February after committing to $10 million in January when the outbreak started. President Trump warned Americans this week to brace for a “rough two-week period” as the White House released grim new projections for as many as 240,000 deaths even if current social distancing guidelines are maintained. “I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead,” he said. “We’re going to go through a very tough two weeks.” The uncertainty was reflected in the stock market Wednesday, with the Dow DJIA, -1.52%, S&P SPX, -1.41% and tech-heavy Nasdaq COMP, -1.28% all deep in the red, at last check, but stocks recovered some lost ground Thursday as President Trump expressed optimism that a damaging price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia can be resolved and after a report China is building its stockpiles. Along with daily news briefings by President Donald Trump and the White House coronavirus task force, daily updates from top governors, notably Andrew Cuomo of New York, Gavin Newsom of California and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois have emerged as must-see events of this pandemic period. Shawn Langlois is an editor and writer for MarketWatch in Los Angeles. Follow him on Twitter @slangwise.

5e5d07eb2e1fe5553d2b63a2	Economic Data Puts the Pound and the Dollar in the Spotlight	It was another busy day on the Asian economic calendar in the earlier hours of this morning. The Aussie Dollar and Kiwi Dollar were in action in the early part of the day. Business and consumer confidence figures were in focus in the early hours. The Westpac Consumer Sentiment Index rose from 103.1 to 109.9 in the 4th quarter. According to the latest Westpac report, The Kiwi Dollar moved from $0.65984 to $0.65967 upon release of the figures that preceded business confidence figures. The ANZ Business Confidence Index rose from -26.4 to -13.2 in December, which was better than a forecasted rise to -13.6 According to the latest ANZ Report, The Kiwi Dollar moved from $0.65905 to $0.65948 upon release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Kiwi Dollar down by 0.02% to $0.6596. According to the ABS, home loans rose by 0.6% in October, month-on-month, following a 1.4% rise in September. Economists had forecast a rise of 1.1%. Alongside the release of the numbers, the RBA also released its minutes from the 3rd December monetary policy decision. Salient points from the minutes included: The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.68762 to $0.68758 upon release of the stats and minutes. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was down by 0.28% to $0.6866 with the dovish minutes weighing early on. At the time of writing, the Japanese Yen was up by 0.02% to ¥109.53 against the U.S Dollar. It’s a relatively quiet day ahead on the economic calendar. Key stats are limited to October trade figures for the Eurozone. Following impressive numbers out of Germany last week, any material narrowing would impact the EUR. Any downside would likely be limited, however, as sentiment towards trade improves following the U.S – China phase 1 agreement. At the time of writing, the EUR was down by 0.01% to $1.1143. It’s a busy day ahead on the economic calendar. Key stats include October wage growth and unemployment figures along with November’s claimant count numbers. Expect the claimant count and wage growth figures to have the greatest impact on the Pound. Following more disappointing private sector PMI numbers on Monday, pressure on the Pound will build should today’s figures raise more red flags… On the political front, Brexit is back in focus. With Johnson planning a 1-year transition, there are doubts over whether there is enough time to negotiate a trade agreement. The EU has certainly raised doubts and if Brexit negotiations are anything to go by, Britain could end up with punitive EU tariffs. It does make sense, however, for Johnson to prevent a neverending period of negotiation. Britain is also a key trading partner with the EU… It’s a 2-way street on this one. At the time of writing, the Pound was down by 0.38% to $1.3281, the early slide coming off the back of concerns over Brexit. It’s a relatively busy day on the data front. Key stats include November industrial production and housing data, along with October’s JOLTs job openings. Expect industrial production figures to have the greatest impact on the data front. At the time of writing, the Dollar Spot Index was up 0.11% at 97.126. It’s a quiet day on the economic calendar. Economic data is limited to October manufacturing sales figures that will provide direction later today. Outside of the stats, expect influence from crude oil prices on the day. The Loonie was down by 0.12% to C$1.3171 against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing.	NZD
5e5d091973d82f5acc8afcff	WTI Gaps Higher after Supply Disruptions	The US equity and bond markets are closed today in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, however the fx markets are open, as well as the overnight session (which is abbreviated) for many futures products. When the crude futures markets opened last night in the US, they gapped higher from a Friday close of 58.58 per barrel to 59.77 per barrel. Supply disruptions in Libya and Iraq over the weekend were the culprits for the price jump. In Libya, military forces shut down a key pipeline. In Iraq, workers protested over working conditions shut down an oil production facility halting oil supply. Price has since pulled back and filled the gap, however WTI is still up 0.4% on the day near 58.75 per barrel. Source: Tradingview, NYMEX, FOREX.com Geo-political events have been the focus since the beginning of 2020 for the oil markets, in particular, between the US and Iran. On January 8th, WTI traded as high as 65.65 as Iran attacked US military bases in in Iraq. However, markets faded the move higher and closed at 59.61, down 5% on the day! Over the course of the next few days, price continued to trade lower, however support at the 200-day moving average near 58.00 held. In addition, there is an upward sloping trendline from the October 1st lows which also held near 58.00. On a daily timeframe, today the price action in crude formed a black bearish candle after the gap higher. Source: Tradingview, NYMEX, FOREX.com On a 240-minute time-frame, WTI not only support from the daily timeframe, but also the 50% retracement level from the lows on October 3rd to the spike high on January 8th, again near 58.00. If price can continue to hold this level, horizontal resistance above comes across near 60.65 and 62.50. Above that, resistance comes across that the previously mentioned spike highs near 65.65. First support is confluence of indicators mentioned near 58.00. Below that is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the previously mentioned timeframe near 56.65 and horizonal support near 55.00. Further support is the October 3rd lows near 51.00. Source: Tradingview, NYMEX, FOREX.com Continue to watch the 58.00 level for WTI. It has proved to be good support in the near term. In addition, notice that moves higher since the beginning of the year due to geo-political events have tended to be faded. Is this a trend? Also, as mentioned in our Oil week ahead write up, Davos begins this week on Wednesday. Watch for comments which may be market moving. We also have the usually weekly API and DOE data due out Wednesday and Thursday, respectively (delayed 1 day due to the US holiday).	ENERGY
5e825c02a241d260a3e6dbb8	South African Rand Hits Record Low	The South African Rand fell to 18.05 versus the U.S. dollar as Moodys (NYSE:MCO) cut the country’s rating to junk, one level below investment grade, and kept the outlook negative. This is the first time the USD/ZAR as ever been above 18.00. Moodys joined S&P and Fitch with ratings below investment grade for South Africa. The ratings firm discussed a “continuing deterioration in fiscal strength and structurally very weak growth.” The downgrade came after South Africa began a three-week country lockdown to try and stop the spread of the coronavirus. USD/ZAR was in a cup-and-handle formation on a daily timeframe since September 2018, breaking out of the handle in early February. The target for a cup-and-handle formation is the depth of the cup, added to the breakout level from the handle, near 17.15. The emerging market pair reached its target in mid-March, as well as, the 161.8% extension level from the highs on Sept. 15, 2018, to the lows of Feb. 1, 2019, at 17.25. With the break above 18.00 today, the pair broke its previous all-time highs last week near 17.88. On a 240-minute time frame, although it looks like the sky is the limit for USD/ZAR, the pair is currently putting in a 3-drive pattern, in which the price makes three higher highs and the RSI makes three lower highs. This is an indication of a possible reversal in price. In addition, the pair has formed a rising wedge formation. However, it still is in the middle of the wedge and doesn’t seem to be breaking down anytime soon. Bulls will be looking to buy dips between horizontal support at 17.60, down to the rising trendline of the wedge near 17.45. Below that, support crosses near the 161.8% retracement level (now acting as support) near 17.25. Resistance is near the top trendline of the rising wedge at 18.30. As this is all-time new highs, it is difficult to find the next resistance however the Fibonacci extension of 261.8% is 19.82. As the coronavirus continues to spread throughout the world, many emerging-market countries will also need to “lockdown.” Many of these countries were already in economic trouble, and the coronavirus couldn’t have come at a worse time. As funds flow into the U.S. dollar and out of less stable economies, such as South Africa, watch for a continued move lower in emerging market currencies versus the U.S. dollar (ie USD/ZAR higher).

5e84f7a2f7b2517e50d8b11a	EUR/JPY Offers Volatility, Without Much USD Correlation	Since February 20th, when the S&P 500 began selling off from its all-time highs, EUR/JPY has been trading in a volatile trading range between 116.12 and 121.40. However, over the last 4 trading days, the pair has traded lower from 121.08 to today’s lows near 116.96, down almost 1.5% today alone. Support doesn’t come in until 85/100 pips lower near 116.00, which is near the long-term downward sloping tending and they March 9th lows. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com One reason for the move lower is because of USD/JPY, which has sold off from a recent high of 111.71 to today's lows of 107.00, while stalling between the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level from the march 9th lows to the March 24th highs. As of late, the pair has a high positive correlation with the DXY at +0.92. A correlation coefficient of +1.00 means the pair move perfectly together in the same direction. Currently, there is a close correlation. Support is below at the 50% retracement level and horizontal support near 106.50. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com The other reason the EUR/JPY is moving lower is because of EUR/USD side of the equation. The pair has been moving lower since Monday’s open. The EUR/USD traded up to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the highs on March 9th to the lows on March 23rd before turning lower. Support is at today’s lows near 1.0900. Notice how highly negatively correlated the EUR/USD is with the DXY. The current reading is -0.99. A correlation coefficient of -1.00 means the 2 assets are perfectly negatively correlated. This is sure pretty close! Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com With the EUR lower vs the USD, and JPY higher vs the USD (USD/JPY lower), it makes sense that the EUR/JPY would be much lower, especially with the high correlations that EUR/USD and USD/JPY have with the US Dollar. However, when we take a look at the correlation of the EUR/JPY to the DXY, the correlation coefficient is only +0.27! There is only a mild correlation to the DXY. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Here’s the point: With initial claims tomorrow and Non-Farm Payrolls on Friday, the US Dollar currency pairs may continue to be volatile over the next few days. If you are looking for a currency pair to trade, but don’t want exposure to the US Dollar, EUR/JPY is a pair to consider.	JPY
5e955d1544a56d7cac252166	Australia: Business confidence collapses – Westpac	The NAB business survey for March provided further confirmation that the COVID-19 medical crisis is also an economic crisis, economists at Westpac Institutional Bank inform. “Business confidence collapsed. The index fell to -66, down from -2 in February.” “Business conditions fell from 0 to -21.” “Manufacturing reported was a -21 - at odds with the AiG’s PMI, which rose to 53.7 in March on the back of increased demand for manufactured food, groceries and personal care items.” “Construction was little changed, at -3. Mining fell to a -42, with the world economy sliding into a deep recession and prices for some commodities (notably oil) moving lower.”	AUD
5e81b63dc496d2354de73068	Investors fret over inverse yield curves and global growth	Wednesday December 5: Five things the markets are talking about Euro and Asian equities fell overnight, following the stateside rout Tuesday, though declines were contained. Currently, U.S equity futures are a tad better bid after China pledged to start delivering on trade agreements reached with the U.S last weekend in Argentina. China’s Commerce Ministry said trade negotiations would proceed “based on a timetable” and it will swiftly execute on items where there is consensus. Since the G20 meeting last weekend, the market has been trying to second-guess the outlook for global growth, with a percentage of the market betting that the Fed will cut interest rates as soon as 2020. Note: U.S equity and fixed income markets will be closed today in a mark of respect in the passing of President George H. W. Bush. Elsewhere, sterling has slipped again, reaching a fresh 18-month low of £1.2672. During parliamentary debate on leaving the E.U, which started yesterday, PM Theresa May suffered several defeats. An amendment was passed that granted members of parliament the right to have a say in future Brexit plans should May’s agreement be rejected next week. In commodities, oil prices come under pressure again as the market waits for tomorrows critical OPEC meeting where production cuts are expected. Saudi Arabia and Russia are set to meet today for a make-or-break preparatory meeting that’s going to set the direction for the oil market. On tap: Bank of Canada (BoC) monetary policy announcement (10:00 am EDT). 1. Equities decline contained for now Stateside yesterday, stocks plummeted more than -3%, led lower by bank and industrial shares, as investors reacted to the inversion of parts of the U.S yield curve with a degree of panic – the 2/5’s spread painted a worrying picture about economic growth. In Japan, the rout continued overnight with the Nikkei falling to a fresh two-week low. The Nikkei share average dropped -0.5%, while the broader Topix also fell -0.5%. Down-under, Aussie shares experienced a similar fate; with recession concerns and doubts about the Sino-U.S trade talks unnerved investors. Broad-based losses pushed the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index down -0.8% at the close. On Tuesday, the index fell -1.0%. In S. Korea, stocks pared deeper declines as investors’ recalibrated expectations from cooling U.S-China trade tensions. The Kospi was -0.6% lower at the close, led by Samsung Electronics, which fell -1.7%. In China, investor doubts over whether China and the U.S would be able to settle their trade dispute before the 90-day deadline expires shook equity prices. At the close, the blue-chip CSI300 index was down -0.5%, while the Shanghai Composite Index fell -0.6%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index closed -1.6%, while the China Enterprises Index lost -1.4%. Note: Data overnight showed that China’s services sector grew (53.8 vs. 50.7) at its quickest pace in five-months in November due to an uptick in new orders, although the outlook for businesses over the next year worsened for the third month. In Europe, regional bourses trade lower across the board following sharp losses in the U.S yesterday and weaker Asian equities. Indices have rebounded off the lows tracking higher U.S futures. U.S futures are in the ‘black’ (+0.57%). Indices: Stoxx600 -0.79% at 355.82, FTSE -0.95% at 6,955.72, DAX -0.79 at 11,245.29, CAC-40 -0.84% at 4,971.93, IBEX-35 -0.69% at 8,999.35, FTSE MIB -0.17% at 19,320.50, SMI -0.97% at 9,003.80, S&P 500 Futures +0.57% 2. Oil prices fall on global growth worries and over supply concerns Oil prices remain under pressure this morning, pulled down by a U.S supply glut and a drop in equity markets. Brent crude oil futures are at +$61.14 per barrel, down -94c, or -1.5% from yesterday’s close, while U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures are at +$52.44 per barrel, down -81c, or -1.5%. Oil prices were pressured by yesterday’s API data that showed that U.S crude inventories rose by +5.4M barrels in the week to Nov. 30, to +448M barrels, in a sign that U.S. oil markets are in a growing glut. Markets attention now turns to tomorrow’s OPEC meeting in Vienna. OPEC+ are working toward a deal to reduce oil output by at least -1.3M bpd. However, Russia’s resistance to a major cut is so far the main stumbling block. Saudi Arabia has indicated a need for steep reductions in output from January, but has come under pressure from President Trump to help support the world economy with lower oil prices. The Saudi’s and Russia are expected to meet today in a “make-or-break preparatory meeting” that’s should set the direction for the oil market. Gold prices are steady in early trading as the ‘big’ dollar trades contained against G10 currency pairs. Spot gold is at +$1,236.85 per ounce. In yesterday’s session, prices touched a peak of +$1,241.86, their highest since Oct. 26. U.S gold futures are down -0.4% at +$1,241.4 per ounce. 3. U.S 10-year Treasury yield falls below 3% U.S government bond prices continue to rally, pushing the yield on 10-year notes further below +3% as investors continue to scramble into longer-term bonds. Concerns about trade tensions with China remain, despite the 90-day truce on tariffs. Investors are also less confident about the ability of the Fed to continue to raise interest rates on the path that policy makers had penciled in at their September meeting. Note: The Fed was forecasting one more rate increase this year (Dec 19 fed funds are pricing an +83% odds for an xmas hike) and three in 2019. Fed funds futures indicate the probability that the Fed meets its forecast or exceeds it at 10%. That compares with 66% odds that it increases rates two times or less. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to a recent +2.928% from +2.990% Monday. Elsewhere, the German 10-year Bund yield is trading at its lowest level of the year, having fallen to +0.26%, while the U.K’s 10-year Gilt yield has gained +1 bps to +1.287%, the first advance in more than a week. While a lot of bad news has already been priced in, December 11, the day of the Brexit deal vote in the U.K parliament, may still result in another spike in risk aversion. 4. Dollar contained for now The ‘big’ dollar remains contained in a tight range against G10 currency pairs. The USD is caught in the cross currents of safe-havens flows, as global stock markets remain volatile, and investors’ realignment of Fed rate hike expectations in 2019. EUR/USD (€1.1339) trades steady despite some upward revisions in the major European Services PMI data – Beats: Euro Zone, France, Spain, and Italy. Miss: UK; In Line: Germany. GBP/USD (£1.2736) was initially higher as the Grieve amendment was perceived to support the pound on reduced Brexit risk of a ‘no-deal Brexit’. However, a miss in Nov PMI Services data (see below) has taken some of the wind out of sterling’s sails. The Japanese yen dipped -0.3% to ¥113.07, the biggest decrease in more than a week. 5. U.K service sector growth eases to 28-month low in November Data this morning showed that the U.K service sector companies experienced another difficult month in November, with both business activity and incoming new work expanding at the weakest rates for almost two-and-a-half years. IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI Business Activity Index fell to 50.4 in November. This was down from 52.2 in October and the lowest reading since July 2016. Digging deeper, survey respondents suggested that subdued business and consumer spending had held back growth and that heightened Brexit uncertainty had led to delays with clients’ business investment decisions. Service providers signalled a slowdown in new business growth for a third consecutive month. This article is for general information purposes only.

5e5d07ce2e1fe5553d2b6380	Economic Data Puts the Greenback in Focus, while Coronavirus Jitters Linger	It was a relatively quiet day on the Asian economic calendar this morning. The Aussie Dollar was in action, with December business confidence figures providing direction early on in the day Outside of the numbers, risk aversion continued to plague the Asian markets in the wake of the sell-off in Europe and the U.S on Monday. Through the morning, while there is some comfort in the efforts to contain the virus, a continued spread could deliver more pain to riskier assets. The NAB Business Confidence Index fell from 0 to an almost 7-year low -2 in December. Economists had forecast an increase to 1. According to the NAB, The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.67574 to $0.67534 upon release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was down by 0.12% to $0.6753, with the numbers yet more bad news for the RBA. At the time of writing, the Japanese Yen was down by 0.11% to ¥109.02 against the U.S Dollar, while The Kiwi Dollar was down by 0.12% to $0.6540. It’s a quiet day ahead on the economic calendar, with no material stats due out of the Eurozone to provide the EUR with direction. A lack of stats will leave the EUR in the hands of the Oval Office and the news wires. While the focus will remain on the spread of the coronavirus, there is also the ongoing threat of U.S tariffs on the EU. At the time of writing, the EUR was up by 0.01% to $1.1020. It’s also a quiet day ahead on the economic calendar, with no material stats due out of the UK to provide the Pound with direction. The focus this week is on the Bank of England’s monetary policy decision and Brexit, as Britain prepares to enter the transition period. Last week’s numbers suggest that the BoE may be able to delay any move, which should continue to limit any major downside. At the time of writing, the Pound was up by 0.05% to $1.3064. It’s a relatively busy day on the data front. Economic data includes house price data, durable goods orders, and consumer confidence figures. We would expect December’s durable goods orders and January’s consumer confidence figures to have the greatest impact. Of interest will be whether the spread of the coronavirus has had any impact on consumer confidence in January. The January survey may be too soon to tell… The Dollar Spot Index was down by 0.02% to 97.939 at the time of writing. It’s another quiet day ahead on the economic calendar, with no material stats due out of Canada. A lack of stats will continue to leave the Loonie in the hands of risk appetite on the day. The Loonie was up by 0.04% at C$1.3189 against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing.	GBP
5e81b5dcc496d2354de7300f	EUR, GBP and Dollar to find a new direction today	Wednesday April 10: Five things the markets are talking about Global equities are mixed overnight on growth concerns and an escalation in trade tensions. Sovereign bond yields have fallen while the ‘big’ dollar trades steady. The market will focus on a number of major events today, the ECB monetary policy announcement, EU summit Brexit extension announcement, the FOMC minutes and U.S inflation data. The ECB meeting is likely to be rather calm. After having played with policy last month, any additional changes are probably sometime away. Expect key interest rates to remain on hold, while the central bank reaffirms its new ‘extended forward guidance’ under which it aims to leave rates. The market does not expect the ECB to announce any further details of the built-in incentives for the next TLTRO. Investors should expect them to continue with the balancing act between demonstrating that it is not running out of ammunition while still keeping everything close at hand. The ECB is considered to be in a ‘wait and see mode.’ As per usual, expect today’s focus will be on questions and answers at President Mario Draghi’s press conference (08:30 am EDT). All sterling position holders are waiting for some fresh news from the EU summit on the U.K’s extension request. Yesterday, U.K parliament approved PM May’s plan to ask for a Brexit extension to June 30. Currently, the market expects the U.K to get another Brexit extension, but longer, up to 12-months and not the short June request by PM May. Under this scenario a general election in the U.K is seen as the most likely scenario. Note: The U.K is technically due to exit the EU on Friday. On tap stateside: U.S banks will soon begin Q1 reporting. The spring meetings of the World Bank Group and the IMF continue in Washington, while the FOMC will release minutes of its March meeting (2:00 pm EDT). 1. Equities looking for a growth sign In Japan, the Nikkei dropped to a one-week low overnight as escalating trade tensions between the U.S and EU and worries about the global growth outlook-tired investor confidence. The Nikkei share average ended -0.5% lower, the lowest closing level since April 3. The broader Topix dropped -0.7%. Down-under, Aussie stocks hardly moved overnight, despite investor appetites taking a sharp hit after the IMF downgraded its global growth forecast a third time since October. The S&P/ASX 200 index, largely unmoved for a second consecutive session, inched up +0.03%. In S. Korea, the Kospi index (+0.5%) saw a late uptick, extending its recent winning streak further into a second week. The Kospi has risen 9 straight days. In China, stocks ended higher overnight, supported by strength in consumer and healthcare companies. The blue-chip CSI300 index rose +0.3%, while the Shanghai Composite Index closed up +0.1%. In Hong Kong, stocks ended lower overnight, amid worries over slower global economic growth and trade tensions. The Hang Seng index fell -0.1%, while the China Enterprises Index lost -0.4%. In Europe, regional bourses are trading mostly higher, coming off earlier lows after a mostly weaker session in Asia overnight. U.S Index futures point a stronger open recouping some of the losses seen Tuesday. U.S stocks are set to open in the ‘black’ (+0.13%). Indices: Stoxx600 +0.08% at 386.44, FTSE -0.07% at 7,420.50, DAX +0.40% at 11,898.49, CAC-40 +0.35% at 5,455.42, IBEX-35 +0.32% at 9,437.90, FTSE MIB +0.22% at 21,719.50, SMI +0.40% at 9,579.50, S&P 500 Futures +0.13% 2. Oil edges up amid tightening supply, but economic slowdown caps gains Oil prices have again inched up overnight amid supply cuts by OPEC+ and U.S sanctions on oil exporters Iran and Venezuela but pressured by expectations that an economic slowdown could soon impede fuel consumption. Brent futures are at +$70.76 per barrel, up +15c, or +0.2%, from Tuesday’s close, while U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures are at +$64.20 per barrel, up +22c, or +0.3%. Note: Both benchmarks hit five-month highs yesterday, before easing on global growth worries. Crude prices have been further lifted this week by escalating violence in Libya, a significant supplier of oil to Europe, which produced around +1.1M bpd of crude in March. Elsewhere, Russia remains a reluctant participant in the supply cuts. It signaled earlier this week that it wanted to raise output when it meets with OPEC in June because of falling stockpiles. Despite the OPEC+ led cuts and U.S sanctions, not all regions are in tight supply. Stateside, crude oil production has risen by more than +2M bpd since early 2018, to a record +12.2M bpd. Data yesterday from the API showed that U.S crude stocks rose by +4.1M barrels in the week to April 5, to +455.8M barrels. Expect dealers to take direction from today’s EIA report at 10:30 am EDT Ahead of the U.S open, gold continues to trade within striking distance of its two-week high print in yesterday’s session, as investors worry about the trade tensions between the U.S and Europe and as the IMF cut its global growth outlook again. Spot gold is down about -0.1% at +$1,303.14 per ounce, after touching its highest since March 28 at +$1,306.09 Tuesday. U.S gold futures are also down about -0.1% at +$1,307.60 an ounce. 3. Sovereign bonds poised for action ahead of ECB and E.U summit announcements A lot of new supply has been taken down globally this week (Germany, U.S, Japan, Italy, Portugal), but despite this, dealers are poised for a busy trading day ahead of a slew of key economic data, the ECB meeting, emergency EU summit at which Brexit will be discussed and U.S inflation data. That been said, it’s no surprise to see sovereign bond yields are lower in early trade, after weak economic growth projections from the IMF yesterday and EU-U.S trade tensions. Peripheral and longer-dated eurozone bonds have also been helped by the strong bid for yield. Germany’s 10-year government bond yield is seen at -0.008%, whilst the yield on 10-year Treasuries has declined -1 bps to +2.49%, the lowest in more than a week. In the U.K, the 10-year Gilt yield is unchanged at +1.104%, while in Japan, the 10-year JGB yield fell -1 bps to -0.053%. 4. FX ranges remain tight FX markets are again quiet as traders remain on the sidelines ahead of today’s key events. EUR/USD (€1.1274) is steady ahead of the ECB rate decision. The market is not expecting any change in policy with focus on Draghi press conference as the overall outlook had not deteriorated enough for the Governing Council to unveil major new stimulus measures. GBP/USD (£1.3075) is a tad higher as E.U Leaders seemed poised to offer the U.K a longer extension with an exit clause to avoid a no-deal outcome. NOK (€9.5949) is a tad firmer after March CPI reading kept the outlook intact for another rate hike by Norges later this year. 5. UK economy grew steadily in February Data this morning from the ONS showed that the U.K economy grew at a slow, but steady pace in the three months through February, aided by a pickup in demand for U.K goods from buyers worried about the effect on supplies of Brexit. The economy grew +0.3% December through February, matching the rate of growth achieved in the three months ending in January. According to the ONS, the expansion was fueled by growth in manufacturing and most services, which offset a drag from the construction sector. Note: Financial services output has not risen on a monthly basis for a year, a record, exceeding even the length of the slump following the financial crisis a decade ago. Financial services output is now -2.3% lower than it was in February 2018, ONS data shows. The ONS said some British factories reported their customers brought forward orders from later in the year to ensure there was no disruption to supplies around the U.K.’s withdrawal from the E.U.

5e5d0866bd5d9d5ac07275b0	Dow Jones, Gold Prices Fall as Yen Soars on Virus Fears. Where to Now?	Declines of -11.49%, -12.36% and -10.97%, these are last week’s performance in the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq respectfully. We have not witnessed such an aggressive decline in sentiment on Wall Street over a 5-day period since 2008. The fragility of the U.S. housing market was at the epicenter of the previous episode, this time around it is the ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus. The anti-risk Japanese Yen stood tall, seeing its best average performance against the US Dollar, Australian Dollar, British Pound and Euro since June 2016. The Greenback flipped from gains to losses. On the one hand, its haven-linked appeal is an asset during times of market pandemonium. On the other hand, it has room to lose its relatively high yield advantage. Anti-fiat Gold, which is typically associated with a “safe-haven” status, underperformed against all odds. Do not underestimate the premium for liquidity during times like these, of which the precious metal loses out against its fiat competitors. Though in the medium-term, it remains high on historical terms. The yellow metal could have room to benefit from what is appearing to be even looser credit conditions ahead. Sentiment-linked crude oil prices extended the aggressive selloff from the beginning of this year as the commodity closed at its lowest since the beginning of 2019. The Canadian Dollar likewise largely underperformed this past week. Oil is a key source of revenue in Canada and lower energy prices can exhibit domestic deflationary pressures, perhaps fueling monetary easing expectations. Central bankers are taking note of the situation, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell alluding to an imminent rate cut on the horizon. Yet, room for maneuver is constrained as most major central banks were not able to unwind easing efforts successfully in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis. This places the weight on fiscal response to counteract downside economic threats. Most new coronavirus cases are now being reported outside of China, with places like South Korea and Japan being closely watched. More reports risk further dampening sentiment on top of next week’s key event risks. These include both economic and political. The incoming “Super Tuesday” from the United States will likely reveal who could be Donald Trump’s challenger in November. OPEC officials will be meeting in Vienna with the coronavirus epidemic threatening global demand further. The Bank of Canada meets to set rates. All eyes at the end of the week turn to the U.S. jobs report. The EU and UK continue with ongoing trade talks to see if both can progress towards a deal. Keep a close eye also on the latest economic outlook update from the OECD. Australian Dollar Eyes RBA and GDP But Coronavirus to Dominate The Australian Dollar faces a packed week of important economic releases, but will even they be enough to shake the market away from the doleful coronavirus headlines? Gold Price Holds Near Yearly High Amid Growing Bets for Fed Rate Cut The threat posed by the coronavirus may keep the price of gold afloat as the shock to the global supply chain fuels bets for lower interest rates. Euro Weekly Outlook: Awaiting EU Talks With UK, CPI and Jobs Data EUR/USD had every reason to fall last week but strengthened instead. That suggests its upward momentum may neutralize fundamental weakness as difficult EU-UK trade talks begin. USD/MXN Outlook: First Two Cases of Coronavirus Confirmed in Mexico The Mexican Peso came under intense selling pressure as the markets posted their worst week since the financial crisis of 2008. Dow Jones and FTSE 100 Forecast for the Week Ahead Catastrophic losses across global equity markets as the coronavirus hits back with a soaring number of cases outside of China. US Dollar Outlook Bullish as COVID-19 Spurs Haven Demand The US Dollar may rally despite the downward pressure of increasing Fed rate cut bets as the coronavirus resurrects haven demand amid growing fear of a recession. Gold Price Outlook: XAU/USD Reversal Risks Larger March Correction Record breaking stock market losses could not support gold with price posting a 7% reversal off seven-year highs. Here are the levels that matter on the XAU/USD chart. Canadian Dollar Outlook: USD/CAD Macro Breakout in Progress The US Dollar is on the verge of confirming a breakout against the Canadian Dollar; it could lead to a sizable rally after last year ‘s trading malaise. Pound Outlook: GBP/USD Finally On the Move Choppy trading conditions are freeing up in-line with FX volatility, the initial move was lower last week, but will that last? Euro Price Outlook Hinges on Breakouts in EUR/USD, EUR/GBP, EUR/AUD The Euro generally had its best week since April 2015, seeing breakouts versus the US Dollar, British Pound and Australian Dollar. What’s next for EUR/USD, EUR/JPY, EUR/GBP, EUR/AUD? Japanese Yen Technical Analysis: Outlook Bullish, Pullback Eyed The Japanese Yen launched a commanding rally from five-year trend support, setting the stage for further gains. A corrective pullback may come first however. Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, DAX 30 Technical Forecasts Last week saw stocks sink through major technical levels as all-time highs were exchanged for panic and record-setting declines. Enjoying relative calm on Friday, have stocks bottomed?	USD
5e6673dcee7db3016ef254b9	Gold Price Pierces $1,700 But Pressured by Stock Market Rout	Gold price action hit a fresh high for the year as XAU/USD skyrocketed above $1,700 overnight – the precious metal’s highest reading since December 2012. Spot gold has since pulled back from its 2% intraday spike, however, and is currently trading around the $1,670 price level. I noted in this week’s gold price forecast that risk of a massive liquidity crunch and dash for cash could pressure the price of gold. This morning’s jaw-dropping 7% plunge in the S&P 500 Index as US equity investors race to hit the sell button, which triggered a limit-down circuit breaker that halted trading on the NYSE for 15-minutes shortly after the open, could in part explain the retracement lower in spot gold. Traders might have been offsetting stock market losses by unwinding long gold positions. There was almost $3 billion net-inflows into the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (ticker symbol: SPY) last week, perhaps driven by market participants attempting to ‘BTFD’ after an emergency Fed rate cut, but the move is being completely reversed so far today with $2.87 billion net-outflows. Desperation for liquidity also seems to have been noticed by the FOMC this morning. The New York Fed announced earlier today that it is increasing the cap on its daily overnight repo operations limit from $100 billion to at least $150 billion. Additionally, two-week term repo offerings will be increased from $20 billion to $45 billion. With the Federal Reserve slashing benchmark interest rates and pumping liquidity into the financial system, gold price action looks like it has potential to resume its near-vertical ascent. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView With gold already notching all-time highs priced in Euro (XAU/EUR) and the Australian Dollar (XAU/AUD), gold priced in US Dollars (XAU/USD) could stretch toward its record highs near $1,900 per ounce. This could be driven by Fed capitulation as the US central bank cuts interest rates to offset economic fallout from the growing coronavirus pandemic and rising recession risk. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView The price of gold looks to have consolidated slightly above the $1,660 level with a notable series of higher lows since this morning’s bottom. The broader month-to-date trendline of support could have potential to keep XAU/USD price action supported as well. If this area of confluence gives way, however, spot gold prices could edge lower toward the $1,640 area. Gold faces short-term technical resistance posed by $1,685 price, which might present an obstacle for XAU/USD before a retest of the psychologically-significant $1,700 zone comes into consideration. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView That said, a monthly gold chart highlights the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the precious metal’s trading range since printing its all-time high in September 2011 slightly above the $1,900 mark, which could serve as another possible topside objective beyond the current year-to-date high.

5e955abcaa7b336fb5cf1fca	Foggy earning season and an upbeat Chinese data under focus – Gold and Oil trade higher	European futures are trading higher as the earnings season that has been lost in the fog begins. Perhaps, this is the most uncertain earning season in history. The US banks will begin the earning season today, and it is JP Morgan that is going to be out of the gates first. Coronavirus has rattled the world economic growth, and it is going to be immensely arduous for companies to go through this period of uncertainty. They do hope that investors do give them a free pass, and do not beat their stocks further. There is no doubt that the economic numbers have been getting that privilege, and the question is if the current earning period is going to get any preferential treatment? Investors do need to keep in mind that it is not this earning period that is going to reflect the actual picture of earnings, in fact – for us – it is the next quarter’s earning that matters the most. It will be only then when we will see the real impact of coronavirus fully reflected in corporate earnings and more clarity to their forward earnings. Going back to the topic of economic numbers, there is enormous optimism in the markets after China reported its import and export numbers today. The numbers were feeble, but they were better than the expectations. Market participants are celebrating this today. Imports declined by 0.9% during March from a year earlier, while the exports dropped by 6.6%. The forecast for export was 13.9%, and for imports, it was 9.8%. The key takeaway from these numbers is that the Chinese economy is restarting again, and the link to the global supply is re-establishing. All of this translates into more positive optimism. This is even though the virus outbreak situation in the US hasn’t reached its peak. Thus, one can always question to what extent the element of collapse in demand is baked into today’s export and import data. But for now, the focus is on the silver lining, and things are looking positive. Back in the commodity spaces, oil prices are trading higher as traders continue to build on the optimism that oil-producing nations have sent a cohesive response to the industry. Although, questions do linger if the US is going to continue to play an important role in the future and if OPEC does hold the same kind of power that it once had. The precious metal crossed the level of $1,700 yesterday, and this has opened the gates to go through the 1,800 mark – our second target. Yesterday’s move confirmed that traders do believe that the loose monetary policy is here to stay, and it will take a long time for the Fed to make a U-turn. Until then, the path of the least resistance for the gold price is skewed to the upside.	ENERGY
5e5d08052e1fe5553d2b63c7	Traders Yawn as EU Agrees to Give UK Brexit Extension	There’s breaking news on Monday, but so far it has had a minimal effect the financial markets. According to reports, the European Union has agreed to give the United Kingdom three more months to exit the bloc. The price action suggests market participants anticipated the event or trader indifference after weeks of confusion over how it would all play out. The details released just a short while ago show that European Council President Donald Tusk, who chaired the talks among the 27 European governments, announced the decision Monday morning on Twitter: “The EU27 has agreed that it will accept the U.K.’s request for a Brexit flextension until 31 January 2020. The decision is expected to be formalized through a written procedure.” Tusk’s announcement came after a meeting between the 27 European ambassadors, in Brussels, where they signed off on a third delay. Another major announcement via Twitter. Perhaps that is why the markets barely sneezed at the news. It wasn’t even important enough to hold a press conference. Furthermore, you have to love it when these stuffy old EU guys try to go all hipster on the rest of us with their attempts to compress their messages into 140 characters. Ok EU27 is acceptable, but “flextension”? Is that like “staycation”, a stay at home vacation? I guess he was attempting to keep up with the times because we’ve all gotten used to “Brexit”, which officially began as British Exit I suppose. I know he was trying to save characters, but then he typed “31 January 2020” ….so. Can you imagine if Twitter were around while they were writing the Magna Carta or the Declaration of Independence? The muted price action suggests investors may shelf Brexit for a few months while shifting their focus on U.S.-China trade and central bank activity. CNBC is reporting that a draft document prepared ahead of the meeting, signed on October 27 says, “With a view to allowing for the finalization of all steps necessary for the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, including the obtaining of the consent of the European Parliament, the European Council agrees to a further extension.” “It notes that the Withdrawal Agreement will enter into force on the first day of the month following the completion of the ratification procedures by the Parties during this period, which ends at the latest on 31 January 2020,” the same document states. Furthermore, “The European Council firmly states that it excludes any reopening of the Withdrawal Agreement in the future and recalls that any unilateral commitment, statement or other act by the United Kingdom should be compatible with the letter and the spirit of the Withdrawal Agreement, and must not hamper its implementation,” the document said. Finally, “The European Council expects the United Kingdom to proceed in parallel with its ratification so that it can enter into force as early as possible.” Trader response to the news seems to be indicating that most of the major players saw it coming. I sincerely hope that one day in the future this situation is resolved to the benefit of the U.K. citizens because at this time I suspect that government lawyers have been cleaning up at their expense. Many years ago, the king of the one-liners Henny Youngman said, “A doctor gave a man six months to live. The man couldn’t pay his bill, so he gave him another six months.” Why am I thinking that this Brexit thing isn’t going to end on January 31, 2020?	GBP
5e944f9b805b697fb30a82a6	Subdued start to the new week	"Overview: European financial centers remain closed for the extended holiday, helping to make for a quiet start to the week. The big economic news over the weekend was the confirmation of the OPEC+ deal. The price of crude opened higher in Asia, but ahead of the US open, May WTI is little changed from the last session on April 9 when it fell $2.3 a barrel on speculation that output would be cut by 10 mln barrels a day, less than half of the projected surplus. Asia Pacific equities are mostly lower, with the Nikkei off 2.3%, leading the way after a nearly 9.5% rally last week. US shares are trading heavily ahead of the start of the earnings season that will be kicked-off by large banks and financial institutions. The dollar has edged up against most major currencies.There are two notable exceptions: the yen, against which the dollar has dipped below JPY108 to trade at an eight-day low, and sterling, which has poked above $1.25 for the first time since March 13. The greenback is firmer against the emerging market complex, the Indonesian rupiah continued last week's 3.5% recovery, the Russian rouble is extending its recovery for the eighth consecutive session. Gold is consolidating below $1700. Virus infections appear on the rise in Singapore in recent days after having looked to be subdued. Similarly, the Chinese city of Harbin has had to delay some relaxation measures due to a fresh flare-up of the virus. Some observers see rolling shutdowns as the next phase in combatting Covid-19 that are more targeted than the national closures. Japan's budget includes JPY220 bln (~$2 bln) to help its companies move production back to Japan. Another JPY23.5 bln was to facility onshoring from other countries back home. Before the weekend, US economic adviser Kudlow expressed interest in creating new tax incentives for American businesses to do something similar. The US tariffs on the bulk of imports from China had already encouraged US companies to re-think supply chains, and anecdotal reports suggest the Covid-19 disruption is further pushing considerations in this direction. There is a countervailing force, too, that ought not to be forgotten, and it stems from the size of China's domestic market. For example, China is GM's biggest market, and Apple's second-largest. Some foreign companies are going to maintain a significant presence in China to be close to a large and still fast-growing market, even if not as fast before. The dollar tested support near JPY107.80 after finishing last week near JPY108.50. The next support is seen near JPY107.00, the lows set at the start of the month. It is the fifth session of lower highs. The JPY108.20 area may offer initial resistance in North America. After surging to about $0.6365 on April 9, the last time the local market was open, the Australian dollar has been consolidating in a narrow range. Although $0.6400 may offer some psychological resistance, the $0.6450 area corresponds with a (61.8%) retracement of this year's decline. On the downside, a break of $0.6370 would undermine the constructive technical tone. The US dollar frayed the lower end of its recent range against the Chinese yuan near CNY7.05 but moved back above there today. The PBOC fix was at CNY7.03, a little softer than the bank models suggest. The IMF and World Bank semi-annual meetings (now virtual) will be held at the end of the week. Reports indicate that around half of the countries have inquired about multilateral assistance. Turkey claims not to be one of them, despite the immense pressures and limited reserves. Although its gross reserves are around $90 bln, the net reserves, or what is useable is seen as closer to $27.5 bln. Still, even this may exaggerate what is genuinely available or unencumbered. Turkey is unwilling to seek IMF assistance, but its backup plan does not seem particularly promising. It is seeking swap lines primarily with the US. That said, it does have a swap line with Qatar and China. The swap line with Qatar was initially for $3 bln in 2018 and was increased to $5 bln last year. The swap line with China is considerably smaller, but Turkey is one of the few countries to use this facility though Beijing has many. It swapped a billion dollars worth of yuan to Turkey last year for the equivalent lira. Turkey has about $172 bln of debt coming due over the next 12 months. The cost of insuring against a default (5-year USD CDS) has more than doubled to 550 bp since the end of January. There are a handful of countries where insurance is more expensive. These include Ukraine, Ecuador, Argentina, Costa Rica, Nigeria, and Egypt. In the UK, 100,000 small companies have drawn around GBP1 bln, according to the Local Government Association. The small business program grants eligible businesses up to GBP10k, while companies in the retail and hospitality sectors can take up to GBP25k. There has been criticism in numerous countries, including the UK, Germany, and the US, for a slow start, confusing instructions, and overwhelmed computer systems. Now that many countries have announced various support programs, the distribution of the aid is the challenge, and the enormity of the effort makes for likely bottlenecks. It will be addressed in the period ahead. The euro is consolidating between roughly $1.0920 and $1.0960. It did marginally extend last week's 1.25% advance to almost $1.0970, its best level since April 1. This area corresponds to the (50%) retracement of the decline from the March 30 high near $1.1165 to the $1.0770 low on April 3 and April 6. The next retracement (61.8%) is found around $1.1010. Sterling has been knocking on the $1.25 area for the better part of two and a half weeks, and although it pushed above there today, it needs to be confirmed. The break took place in rather thin activity, and the move a little past $1.2535 appeared to have been flattered by stops being triggered. Note that the $1.2515 area corresponds to a (61.8%) retracement of sterling's decline from the March 9 high near $1.3200 to the March 20 low close to $1.1415. If the breakout is confirmed, the next target is seen by the 200-day moving around $1.2655. OPEC+ confirmed the new deal a few hours before the markets opened. Mexico's balk means the output cut is for about 9.7 mln barrels starting in May and June, and then 8 mln in H2 and 6 mln barrels in 2021 until April 2022. The significant change over the past month is that Russia, which rejected cuts before, has now capitulated as the consequences of the collapse in oil prices adds to the punishment of the Russian economy. The Saudis also got other OPEC producers to participate in cuts. Although without much detail, Trump reported offered to make up most of the cut OPEC was asking of Mexico. Still, US Energy Secretary Brouillette suggested that US output will fall by at least 2 mln barrels per day by the end of the year and probably closer to 3 mln, which is more than the EIA projected. Separately, Aramco set its official selling price after a few day delay. Despite the agreement, Aramco will cut prices to Asia next month by $2.95-$5.50 a barrel and raise them between $2.50 and $4.20 for US shipments. The price for Europe will be left unchanged. Ahead of the weekend, the US Justice Department requested that the FCC terminate China Telecom's authorization to operate in the US, citing ""national security risks."" China Telecom is state-owned. Last year, the US banned China Mobile, which does not appear to be state-owned. Separately, there are numerous requests for waivers for tariffs the US has on a range of China-made medical supplies, including hand sanitizers and disinfectants. Just because the Federal Reserve has taken incredible actions to ensure different segments for the capital markets function, it does not mean that consumers will be given much of a break. Credit card interest rates have not been reduced, and banks may still tighten their lending standards. JP Morgan, for example, ahead of the weekend, announced higher standards for new mortgages starting tomorrow. Borrowers will need a credit score of at least 700 and make a 20% downpayment. We suggested that three deals were pending on April 9: OPEC+, Eurogroup, and US Congress. The first two have been achieved, even if under-whelming. The third remains incomplete. The White House and the Senate want Congress to authorize another $250 bln for its small business program. Recall that in the $2.2 trillion packaged nearly $350 bln was earmarked for forgivable loans to small businesses who maintained their employee headcount or rehired employees. Reports indicated that about half the fund has been committed in nearly 590k applications through 4100 lending institutions. The Democrats are seeking to double the size of the Senate's bill to include another $100 bln for hospitals and $150 bln for state and local governments. Congress is on a two-week spring recess, and if a unanimous agreement is not struck, funding will likely be delayed. The US dollar is trading at the lower end of where it has been against the Canadian dollar in almost a month around CAD1.3920. In the last couple of weeks, the Canadian dollar seems most sensitive to the general risk appetites (proxy: S&P 500), rather than commodities (proxy: oil). Early equity losses suggest the likelihood of greenback upticks. Initial resistance is seen near CAD1.40 and then CAD1.4080. Mexico President AMLO succeeded in resisting pressure for larger cuts in oil output, but it has done the peso little good. The US dollar fell every day last week against the peso for a cumulative 6.8% decline (after having appreciated by nearly 7.2% in the previous week). It dipped below MXN23.25 initially today but will begin the North American session around MXN23.45. The band of nearby resistance extends to MXN23.60."	ENERGY

5e5d0886bd5d9d5ac07275c0	Crude Oil Prices Down as Coronavirus Spread Bites Growth Prospects	Crude Oil and Gold Talking Points: Crude oil prices were lower in Friday’s Asian trade and on track for a weekly fall of well over 10%, as the coronavirus worries which crushed Wall Street in the previous session continued to hammer such risk-correlated markets The virus continues to spread with first infections discovered in New Zealand and a case of unknown origin recorded in the United States. Investors increasingly worry that the outbreak will become a pandemic which could threaten global recession according to a large and growing group of market watchers. Energy markets still strongly suspect that production cuts will be coming in March from traditional producers in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia. However, given the magnitude of this week’s stock market falls it’s now becoming more doubtful that even these will be able to raise prices meaningfully in the face of falling demand and plentiful supply from non-OPEC sources. Perhaps surprisingly gold prices slipped a little through the session, despite the strength of other counter-cyclical haven assets like the Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc. The precious metal remains well supported close to the eight-year highs registered early next week and, like those other assets, seems highly unlikely to see meaningful falls while the virus runs its course. However, the market looks consolidative, after a rise of nearly $200/ounce this year, even if a push higher looks likely once that process ends. Crude oil prices continue to track lower within this year’s well-established daily chart downtrend channel. The bears are probing the lower levels of a support band from January 2019 and where it closes out Friday’s session will be interesting from both a weekly and monthly closing perspective. A close below the line will bring channel support at $43.45 into focus but that point might not be sustainably reached until OPEC’s plans are apparent. Gold prices are flirting with the $1632.33 mark that coincides with the first, 23.6% Fibanacci retracement of the rise from November’s lows. A break below this on a monthly close could see a deeper pullback in prospect, perhaps as far as the $1590 area where the market topped out on January 6 and 31. However it looks very unlikely that gold’s fundamental bid will be eroded much beyond that point for as long as the coronavirus story is dominant, with continued gains still the most likely outcome once consolidation is past. --- Written by David Cottle, DailyFX Research Follow David on Twitter@DavidCottleFX or use the Comments section below to get in touch!

5e6168e8ad89ae43cca6a5c8	U.S. dollar at two-month low as traders see more Fed rate cuts	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slipped to a fresh eight-week low as U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell to new troughs and traders bet the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates further, after slashing them by 50 basis points this week in an emergency move to shield the economy from the effects of the coronavirus. Monetary policy easing in the United States, fueled by worries about the economic impact of the coronavirus, is endangering the dollar’s years-long rally and giving a boost to currencies around the world. On Thursday, the dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six other major currencies, was about 0.8% lower at 96.639, after slipping as low as 96.608, its weakest since Jan. 6. Money markets were pricing in another 25 basis-point-cut from the current 1% to 1.25% range at the next Fed meeting on March 18-19 and a 50-basis-point cut by April. “The cuts were emergency, so it’s worth wondering, will the Fed strike again like this or will they telegraph another move? It seems like they’re willing to help at any point, thus the lack of faith in the buck is understandable,” said Juan Perez, senior foreign exchange trader and strategist at Tempus Inc in Washington. The fast-spreading coronavirus, which emerged late last year in central China, is now in some 80 countries and has killed more than 3,000 worldwide. Against the Japanese yen, which tends to attract investors during times of geopolitical or financial stress because Japan is the world’s biggest creditor nation, the dollar fell 1.2% to a six-month low and was last at 106.22 yen. “Wall Street was down nearly 3% at midsession, while Treasury yields headed to fresh all-time lows, both combining to weigh heavily on the pairing,” said Ronald Simpson, managing director of global currency analysis at Action Economics. The dollar found little support from data that showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week, suggesting the labor market was on solid footing despite the coronavirus outbreak. The Canadian dollar weakened against its U.S. counterpart on Thursday, a day after the Bank of Canada delivered its biggest interest rate cut in more than 10 years and signaled it was ready to ease further because of the coronavirus outbreak. Sterling gained 0.7% against the greenback as expectations waned for an immediate Bank of England rate cut to follow this week’s emergency move by the Fed. Incoming BoE governor Andrew Bailey dampened expectations of an inter-meeting cut late on Wednesday, telling lawmakers the central bank should wait until it has more clarity about the economic hit from the outbreak.

5e7a2a8d0047e02db43dd5a1	Infinite Fed Easing, Finite Market Bounce	No matter how big the guns the Fed pulls out QE infinity this time - the market is still in a state of 'glass half empty' when it comes to buying into the old mantra of 'the Fed Put', which gained widespread popularity on the belief that the Fed can always rescue the economy and equities. The market told us on Monday, again, that these paradigms are shifting... The Fed has gone all in with QE infinity and yet stocks, despite a short-term spell of strength, are largely unfazed, with the S&P 500 closing down near the 3% mark. In a world where demand and supply have been decimated amid the fastest descent into a bear market in history, week after week, we have further evidence that the Fed’s old tricks are no longer working. Still, they are necessary to provide a backstop in the avalanche of bankruptcies that would eventuate otherwise in a global economy that is imploding for desperate measures. It’s precisely this state of despair that is forcing Germany to break its own long-held rules of a balanced budget by signing off a €750 billion economic package to combat the virus fallout, the US soon to approve the release of $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus, RBA/RBNZ testing the waters of QE, etc. The last country to cave in and go into lockdown is the UK, which only reinforces the notion that since the countries where the main financial centers exist (NY, London) are just getting started to toughen the rules, we should be expecting worsening virus stats before they turn the corner. In the currency market, even if QE infinity has done little to lift the equity valuations, the US Dollar has seen a temporary pause in its macro bull phase after recently breaking into all-time highs at an index level. The Oceanic currencies benefited from the Fed announcement, as did the Euro and the Swiss Franc. The worst performers included the GBP, CAD, and JPY. The weekly aggregation of forex flows reveals some great insights on the potential directional biases each G8 currency may follow in weeks to come. The technical observation when stepping back and staring at these macro outlook tells me that the USD run is just ⅓ mature in the full scale of its potential magnitude. It also suggests the EUR faces some major stumbling block overhead backed up by 10 years worth of price action data. The Pound remains a fragile currency as drawing parallels with GFC tells us more weakness should be expected. However, no currency offers more technical value than short CAD. On the complete opposite side of the spectrum is the Yen, with the aggregation of flows finally providing sufficient validation to make me think that the next cyclical bull run is now underway (15%+ potential). The AUD has rebounded from its most relevant support in a decade, so those following my daily deconstruction of flows won’t be too surprised to see AUD appreciation. The NZD has transitioned into a cyclical bear trend with a very ambitious downside target from current levels. Lastly, the CHF is looking like it may soon validate a huge technical breakout. Let’s now get started with a look at every index…	USD
5e9631274528a944800a6159	Market talk: The IMF foresees the US economy shrinking by 5.9% this year	India has extended its national lockdown until May 3, 2020. Prime Minister Modi announced this decision today in a televised address to the nation. After April 20, some states that have avoided outbreaks may be allowed to resume. The country has at least 10,363 reported cases, including 339 deaths, according to the Ministry of Health. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) further slashed India’s growth estimate for FY21 to 1.9% from 5.8% that they estimated in January. The IMF is warning that the result may be the “worst recession since the Great Depression” that will dwarf the economic damage caused by the global financial crisis a decade back. It also said that India and China would be the only two major economies likely to register growth, with all others contracting. The Daily Telegraph has stopped publishing lucrative Chinese branding daily material amid growing scrutiny over how Beijing is using the pandemic to expand its influence in English-language media aimed at western audiences. The removal of the paid-for sections comes as China aims to improve its standing with western audiences amid the pandemic. The Chinese government is handing out cash to car buyers to help the world’s biggest auto market get back on its feet after the coronavirus pandemic. The auto industry plays a crucial role in China’s economy. More than 40 million people in the country rely on the sector for jobs, either directly or indirectly. The industry generates more than $1 trillion in revenue each year, or roughly 10% of China’s manufacturing output. The major Asian stock markets had a green day today: The major Asian currency markets had a mixed day today: Precious Metals: Some economic news from last night: China: Exports (YoY) (Mar) increased from -17.2% to -6.6% Imports (YoY) (Mar) increased from -4.0% to -0.9% Trade Balance (USD) (Mar) increased from -7.09B to 19.90B South Korea: Export Price Index (YoY) (Mar) decreased from -2.0% to -3.3% Import Price Index (YoY) (Mar) decreased from -1.0% to -7.7% Australia: NAB Business Confidence (Mar) decreased from -4 to -66 NAB Business Survey (Mar) decreased from 3 to -21 New Zealand: External Migration & Visitors (Feb) decreased from 2.90% to -10.80% Permanent/Long-Term Migration (Feb) increased from 6,860 to 8,250 Visitor Arrivals (MoM) decreased from -1.3% to -7.7% Some economic news from today: Indonesia: Deposit Facility Rate (Apr) remain the same at 3.75% Lending Facility Rate (Apr) remain the same at 5.25% Interest Rate Decision remain the same at 4.50% European markets were mixed, albeit not highly volatile after opening up from a two day Easter break. The IMF said today that it expects global growth to shrink by 3%, and more developed economies by 6.1%, which would signal the worst decline in GDP since the Great Depression of the 30s. European countries are beginning to ease restrictions. Italy and Spain are cautiously easing restrictions and allowing people to grocery shop. Current expectations are for a full opening of the economy in May. The UK and EU have once again restarted trade talks post-Brexit. The Daily Express released an article suggesting that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak was confident that a trade deal could be negotiated on time regardless of the coronavirus disruption. He also mentioned later in the day that the UK will be suffering some tough times ahead. The Office for Budget Responsibility said that the economy could shrink as much as 35% by June! A leading German politician Gunther Oettinger said that the EU needed to be tougher on “debt rebels,” as described by the UK express. He was, of course, talking to the likes of Italy who has a debt to GDP ratio of around 135%. Italy is contemplating following the UK and leaving the EU. Gunther went on to talk about how European countries in good years should build up reserves or pay off old debts to be better prepared for a crisis. The major Europe stock markets had a mixed day today: The major Europe currency markets had a mixed day today: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) released a report today in which they predict the global economy will contract by 3% in 2020. The organization is referring to the current situation as “the Great lockdown” and said we should not expect to see a recovery until 2021. “The magnitude and speed of collapse in activity that has followed [the lockdown] is unlike anything we’ve experienced in our lifetimes,” Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s chief economist, said. The IMF foresees the US economy shrinking by 5.9% this year and Canada’s economy contracting 6.2%. “It is assumed that [in a longer shutdown] there will be some longer-lived damage realized in 2021 in the form of capital destruction, a temporary slowing in productivity growth, and a temporary increase in trend unemployment,” the report stated. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida told Bloomberg News on Monday that the Fed has the tools to keep the US out of deflation. “I always thought that if we got hit it would be a shock to aggregate demand, and that is what I think it is,” Clarida said, noting that the Fed is working to “offset” that issue. When asked about interest rates, Clarida said it would be “a long way down the road” before the Fed considered raising rates which are currently at 0%. Biotech company Moderna announced today that it concluded phase one trials for a potential Zika virus vaccine. The company is currently working on producing a COVID-19 vaccine as well, and the successful first phase of Zika trials has many optimistic that their COVID-19 vaccine may prove effective too. “We expect the safety and tolerability profile of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to be very similar from the other vaccines. And so I think we start to be in a place where we are cautiously optimistic,” CEO Stéphane Bancel stated. US Market Closings: Canada Market Closings: Brazil Market Closing: The report by the IMF today suggesting that major economies will have dismal growth this year caused oil prices to plunge. WTI and Brent dropped 8% and 7% respectfully with WTI hovering over the 20 USD mark.

5e5d07eb2e1fe5553d2b639e	Economic Data Puts the Loonie and Greenback in Focus Today	It was a relatively quiet day on the Asian economic calendar in the earlier hours of this morning. The Aussie Dollar was in action early on, with November private sector credit figures providing direction. Support for the Aussie Dollar and Kiwi Dollar kicked in this morning. News of the U.S and China planning to sign the phase 1 agreement in early January provided support. For the Aussie Dollar Private sector credit rose by 0.1% in November, month-on-month, according to figures released by RBA, falling short of a forecasted rise of 0.3%. In October, private sector credit had risen by just 0.1%. The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.68985 to $0.68984 upon release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was up by 0.13% to $0.6909. At the time of writing, the Kiwi Dollar up by 0.17% to $0.6610, while the Japanese Yen was flat at ¥109.44 against the greenback. It’s a quiet day ahead on the economic calendar. There are no material stats de out of the Eurozone to provide the EUR with direction. A lack of stats will allow the markets to consider what lies ahead, with volumes likely to be on the lighter side. There’s Brexit, the threat of tariffs on EU goods, disappointing consumer confidence and private sector PMI and employment numbers to consider. The good news is that the threat of a dismemberment abated as the year progressed and Lagarde may be the right person for the top job at this juncture. At the time of writing, the EUR was down by 0.01% to $1.1078. It’s also a quiet day ahead on the economic calendar, with no material stats due out of the UK to provide the Pound with direction. While there is a lack of data, the markets may begin to consider what lies ahead with Johnson sitting with a comfortable majority. Unlike his counterpart in the U.S, he doesn’t have to concern himself with the opposition… If he sticks to the script and deviates only slightly, he may also provide a much-needed boost to the UK that pretty much stagnated over the last 3-years. At the time of writing, the Pound was up by 0.11% to $1.3013. It’s a busier day on the data front, with November new home sales due out later today. With stats and volumes on the lighter side, we can expect the Dollar to be responsive to the numbers. Any negative numbers would likely have a muted impact, however, following impressive housing starts and building permit figures released last week. On the geopolitical risk front, perhaps some final pearls of wisdom from the U.S President’s Twitter account? At the time of writing, the Dollar Spot Index was down by 0.02% to 97.668. It’s a relatively busy day on the economic calendar. October GDP numbers are due out later this afternoon. Following some pretty unimpressive numbers last week, any weak numbers will sink the Loonie further. The BoC may be looking to hold out, however, with the USMCA and Phase 1 agreement providing support. New trade terms are going to take some time to wash out the effects of punitive tariffs to support global trade terms… As we know, the markets have a tendency to be rather impatient… The Loonie was up by 0.05% to C$1.3154 against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing.

5e94d2d85fa3c72dace92307	Wall Street Close: A mixed session as markets start to return scanning for COVID-19 risks	"US benchmarks were coming off their lows on Monday's session while investors weighed the prospects of the US economy getting a kick start with US President Donald Trump's eagerness to get the population back to work. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 329 points, or 1.4%, to end near 23,391 while the S&P 500 lost 1% to end around 2,762. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.5% to close at 8,192. Overall, it was a directionless day with European and Asian markets out for Easter celebrations on Monday, while investors tried to weigh the prospects of global growth returning in a V-shaped recovery should the curve indeed be starting to flatten in developed nations such as Europeans, the UK, Australasia and the US. At the same time, the OPEC+ accord is a positive for risk-appetite in the long run, although the production cut is seen as too little too late for oil prices. More on that here and here, WTI: OPEC+ has not done enough and Trump knows it. ""With the world having just experienced its second-warmest March ever, it’s true that’s a lot fewer carbon emissions, but it’s a pretty brutal way to get there. And a USD23 oil price won’t do anything to encourage alternative energy development,"" – analysts at TD Securities argued."	USD
5e681a4ed53f7f7b131418b3	EUR/USD Correcting Overbought, Potentially Aimed To 1.1300	Global markets are growing on Tuesday morning in anticipation of coordinated central bank stimulus measures and government attempts to stop panic sales in the markets. Today, markets are moving in the opposite direction to Monday's dynamics, offsetting some of the losses (or gains) the day before. The EUR/USD, which reached 1.1495 on Monday, slid back to 1.1360 before the start of trading in Europe. Since February 20, the pair jumped by 6.6%, which made it vulnerable rollback. There are also more fundamental reasons for this correction.	USD
5e5d07b6203be655205b7ac5	Dollar gains on strong private payrolls, report of virus treatment	The dollar gained against the safe-haven yen and Swiss franc on Wednesday, as risk appetite rose on reports of a possible treatment for the new coronavirus out of China that has gripped the world and caused major disruptions among global businesses. The U.S. currency also benefited from a private-sector payrolls report for January that surpassed market expectations, suggesting the world’s largest economy was on a stable growth path and interest rate cuts were off the table for now. The focus, though, remained on the coronavirus, which has claimed 490 lives, most in and around the locked-down central city of Wuhan, where the new virus emerged late last year. There have been two deaths outside mainland China: in the Philippines and Hong Kong, both following visits to Wuhan. But the yen and Swiss franc fell after media reported a Chinese university had found a drug to treat people with the virus, while researchers in Britain had made a “significant breakthrough” in finding a vaccine. While the Chinese report was a day old and the British report indicated the research trials were in early stages, traders used the headlines to load up on risky assets. “The market is starting to brush off the coronavirus,” said Erik Nelson, currency strategist, at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. “What’s driving this are some of the headlines on possible vaccines. So there is some optimism about having potentially a way to treat the symptoms from having the coronavirus.” Risk sentiment also improved after U.S. private-sector payrolls increased by 291,000 in January, according to the ADP National Employment Report, far above expectations of an increase of 156,000 jobs. January’s job gains were the largest since May 2015. In addition, U.S. services sector activity picked up last month, with industries reporting increases in new orders. The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing activity index rose to 55.5 last month, the highest level since August. “The U.S. has shown quite a bit of resilience for a long time and to the extent that the global economy is going to turn the corner, that’s good for the U.S.,” said Wells Fargo’s Nelson. In afternoon trading, the dollar rose 0.3% against the yen to 109.79 yen, after earlier rising to a two-week high of 109.84 yen. It also rose 0.5% versus the Swiss franc to 0.9735 franc. The euro, meanwhile, fell 0.4% to $1.0994, pushing the dollar index up 0.3% at 98.29.	USD
5e65ca8e9f711d48d6b53891	Currencies in South Korea, Australia and New Zealand crumble as market volatility shoots up	Major Asia Pacific currencies dropped against the U.S. dollar on Monday morning, as investors took a risk-off approach with volatility across markets shooting up over an oil price war. The Australian dollar fell as much as 2.60% against the greenback to $0.6476, while the New Zealand dollar tumbled by as much as 2.28% to last change hands at $0.6228. The Korean won declined more than 1% against the dollar, prompting South Korea’s finance ministry to issue a verbal warning against “excessive” movements in the currency market, according to a Reuters report. “We’re closely monitoring speculative transactions that seems to be taking advantage of unstable market sentiment. The herd-like behavior (in the won) seems excessive short-term,” a finance ministry official told Reuters. Investors tend to regard phone messages from foreign exchange authorities as official verbal interventions in the onshore currency market, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, investors flocked to the safe-haven Japanese yen which soared more than 3% against the dollar to last settle at 102.10, dramatically strengthening from levels above 108 early last week. But Japan’s Finance Minister Taro Aso warned against investors rapidly driving up the yen, saying the government will watch the currency spike closely, describing them as “nervous moves,” according to Reuters. “We must watch currency and stock market moves for a while. We’ll examine them carefully,” Aso told reporters, according to the report. He declined to comment on whether Japan needs to intervene in the currency market. Turmoil across markets spiked on Monday during Asia hours. Oil prices plunged as much as 30%, with U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures briefly falling to $27.95 per barrel. It came after OPEC’s failure to strike a deal with its allies regarding production cuts. That caused Saudi Arabia to slash its prices as it reportedly gets set to ramp up production, leading to fears of an all-out price war. Dow futures followed the same trajectory, tumbling more than 1,000 points, with the 10-year Treasury yield dropping below 0.5% for the first time ever as price war fears coupled with coronavirus concerns sent investors flocking to safety. Markets across Asia dived on Monday morning. Shares in Japan plummeted more than 6%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped almost 4%. South Korea’s markets declined more than 4%. Australian markets also tumbled nearly 6%, with energy stocks taking a beating. — CNBC’s Pippa Stevens and Yun Li contributed to this report.	USD
5e94c007d3c2764da03771de	GBP/USD Forecast: Bulls taking over, despite discouraging pandemic-related news	The pound has resumed its advance against the greenback, with GBP/USD pair retaking the 1.2500 figure. The pair held on to gains despite worsening risk-related sentiment led to dollar’s gains, amid weekend news indicating that UK PM, Boris Johnson, left the hospital. Johnson has spent most of the past week in ICU amid persistent coronavirus symptoms, spurring concerns about leadership The Sterling advanced despite comments from UK Chancellor Sunak, who warned that the UK’s GDP could fell between 25% to 30% in the second quarter of the year. Also, the kingdom reported that the number of coronavirus infections climbed to 88,621 and that the death toll increased to 11,329. The lack of dollar’s demand has offset these negative news. The GBP/USD pair is trading below its daily high of 1.2536, hovering around a critical Fibonacci level, the 61.8% retracement of its March slump at 1.2515. The pair offers a neutral-to-bullish perspective in its 4-hour chart, as the pair is developing above all of its moving averages, and with the 20 SMA advancing above the larger ones. Technical indicators, in the meantime, hold within positive levels, although without clear directional strength. Further gains are to be expected on a break above 1.2540, where the pair topped on March 13.

5e955d1544a56d7cac25216c	JPY Futures: Positive momentum seen unchanged	In light of flash data for JPY futures markets from CME Group, open interest rose for the second session in a row on Monday, this time by almost 1.4K contracts. Volume, instead, went down by nearly 15.5K contracts, prolonging the choppy performance. USD/JPY’s negative price action at the beginning of the week was on the back of rising open interest, opening the door to the continuation of the descent at least in the short-term horizon. Against this, a drop and test of the monthly low in the 107.00 neighbourhood looks well on the table.	JPY
5e81b610c496d2354de7304e	Strong US Data, Trade Solace, & Consistent Fed Speak Drive Strong Dollar and Risk Narrative	The US dollar rally continues to be supported by strong US data, accommodative comments from Fed officials, and a very strong US stock market. This week also saw big shifts in interest rate probabilities, the market shifted from seeing the next move go from a cut to now favoring a rate hike. Next week will provide many catalysts for the next major move with risk assets. China’s trade talks with the US remain the main risk event for the financial markets, but traders will closely watch the fourth quarter Chinese GDP reading which is expected to shrink from 6.5% to 6.4%. Brexit will also remain on the docket as Prime Minister May will need to wrap up cross-party talks and come up with a Plan B by Monday. May will likely have to extend Article 50, but if she is unsuccessful, things can get ugly very quickly for cable. Early on Wednesday, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is expected to keep policy steady, but they could lower their inflation and growth projections. US economy and Fed Speak This week, US economic data came in mixed with fairly stronger results at the end. On Wednesday, Import and Export prices came in better than expected, the NAHB Housing Market Index also rose as mortgage prices fell, and the Beige Book painted a picture of a strong economy with escalating worries. Thursday, the data was solid as both Jobless claims data came in better than expected and the Philadelphia Fed Business Outlook rebounded and ended a string of weaker prints. Friday’s data saw manufacturing post a strong rebound. The Industrial Production data rose 0.3% in December from the prior month and Manufacturing Production, which is the majority of the nation’s total industrial output climbed 1.1% in December, the best rise in 11-months. We do continue to see several key economic releases be affected by the government shutdown. Some attribute the lack of weakening data points from the US as another reason of support for recent rally in risk appetite. Fed speak this week was in-line with what Fed Chair Powell set out earlier in January. The key phrases that Fed officials repeated this week were: Economy performing well, Fed can be patient, and reassess balance sheet if conditions change. The Fed’s dovish stance is firmly in place and high-beta currencies may finally start to rally if the trade truce is extended and we see global concerns ease. US equities have a strong start to earning season US stocks continue to roar ahead on trade optimism, ignoring the partial government shutdown that is showing no signs of ending. The S&P 500 index finished higher for a fourth consecutive week, also surging past some key technical levels. Friday’s rally followed the CNBC report that China reportedly offered a six-year increase in US imports worth $1 trillion to eliminate US trade imbalances by 2024. US negotiators were said to be skeptical of the offer and wanted the imbalance removed within two years. Talks will resume at the end of the month and optimism is growing that enough progress is being made for the US to hold off raising tariffs after the March 1st deadline. The major banks kicked off earning season this week and delivered mixed results. The general view we saw this week on the consumer and business climate was positive and that helped stocks remain bid for most of the week. No end in sight for partial government shutdown The government shutdown has reached its 28th day on Friday and we are not seeing any signs of compromise from both sides. We will most likely need to see a large event that forces government officials to agree on a deal. It may require TSA employees staying at home and disrupting air travel or if we wait till the end of the March when federal funding runs out for food stamps. The 800,000 furloughed workers financial pain continues to grow each pay period that passes, and the political price is growing on both sides. Oil benefiting from US/China trade optimism Oil’s rebound continued this week as OPEC’s cuts appear to be working. Friday’s surge stemmed from positive steps in trade talks between the US and China. A framework of a deal is nowhere close, but we are starting to see significant concessions offered by China. US crude is up 18% this year, the best start since 2001. The global supply glut concerns have eased but will likely return if we see prices retake the $60 a barrel level. If we do see a perfect storm of risk appetite, ending of shutdown, trade truce extended and solid earnings reporting, we could see a major leg higher for oil. OPEC however, will unlikely be keen to see prices extend back towards the $75 region, as that is where the majority of US shale players need WTI to reach in order to be profitable.

5e61264a5127537fa5b3bc8f	USD/NOK Holds Above An Uptrend Line	USD/NOK has been trading in a consolidative manner since yesterday, between the 9.230 and 9.295 barriers. That said, on Tuesday, the pair rebounded from the uptrend line drawn from the low of January 2nd and as long as it continues to trade above that line, we would consider the short-term outlook to be positive. But, before we get confident on decent advances, we would like to see a clear break above 9.295. Such a move may initially aim for the 9.380 zone, the break of which could extend the recovery towards the 9.440 barrier, marked by the peak of March 2nd. If the bulls are not willing to stop there either, we may see them putting the 9.498 zone on their radars. That zone is defined as a resistance by the high of February 28th. Looking at our short-term oscillators, we see that the RSI rebounded from its 30 line and now looks to be slowly drifting towards its 50 line, while the MACD has bottomed within its negative territory and now lies above its trigger line. Both indicators suggest that the rate may start picking upside speed soon, which supports the idea of a rebound in this exchange rate. In order to start examining the case of a trend reversal, we would like to see a decisive dip below 9.175. This would confirm the break below the aforementioned uptrend line and may initially allow declines towards the lows of January 28th and 29th, at around 9.107. If the bears are strong enough to overcome that hurdle as well, then we may see them pushing towards the 9.028 area, marked by the inside swing high of January 23rd.	NOK
5e95b62288d07249dc65b127	EUR/USD: Gaining upward traction	The EUR/USD pair is pressuring its weekly high ahead of the US opening, although its bullish potential is quite limited, according to FXStreet’s Chief Analyst Valeria Bednarik. “The EUR/USD 4-hour chart shows that it´s trading within directionless moving averages, while the Momentum indicator remains stuck to neutral levels. The RSI advances within familiar levels, currently at 62.” “The EUR/USD pair could extend its advance as long as it holds above 1.0950, a Fibonacci support level, although sustainable gains beyond the 1.1000 figure seem unlikely at the time being.” “Support levels: 1.0950 1.0910 Resistance levels: 1.0990 1.1020”	USD
5e80c64d689da831c745e36f	US Dollar Sinks. Gold Prices, Wall Street Soar on Stimulus. Bottom Found?	The haven-linked US Dollar tumbled this past week, averaging its sharpest decline against a basket of its major counterparts since at least 1986. This is as Wall Street bounced with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 rallying the most over 5 days since 1974 and 2009 respectively. Anti-fiat gold prices also climbed, surging the most last week since 2008. Emerging market capital outflows cooled. The backdrop for this improvement in market sentiment during the coronavirus outbreak has been aggressive stimulus measures undertaken by not just the US, but also countries globally. Focusing on the former, the Federal Reserve introduced open-ended quantitative easing as the government worked together to pass a US$2 trillion virus relief bill to cushion the impact of the virus. Going forward, markets will have to weigh stimulus against incoming data that will continue revealing the severity global growth is facing. The Euro has employment figures from Germany to watch as the United States releases March’s non-farm payrolls report. This follows a record rise in jobless claims. As April gets going, estimates point to the worst contraction in NFPs since 2010. Before the coronavirus outbreak, global growth slowed over the past few years amid the US-China trade war. All eyes were on the world’s largest economy as it relatively outperformed. Now it holds the most cases of COVID-19, surpassing Italy and China. The longer the country embraces social isolation measures, the more consumption (2/3 of GDP) may weigh on domestic and international growth. US Dollar May Rise if ISM, NFP and PMI Data Spurs Haven Demand The US Dollar could rise if key ISM, PMI and nonfarm payrolls data causes recession fears to swell and rekindles appetite for the haven-linked Greenback. Australian Dollar Boosted By Stimulus Hope, Coronavirus Stays in Charge The Australian Dollar has been lifted from its multi-year lows by hopes that global financial authorities can fend of the worst of the coronavirus‘ effects. The economic data are dire though, and likely to remain so. USD/MXN Outlook: Debt Rating Downgrade May Bring Further Weakness for the Peso The Mexican Peso has managed to recover some ground against the US Dollar as risk-appetite resumes Dow Jones and FTSE 100 Forecasts for the Week Ahead Dow Jones posting a bear market rally? Federal Reserve provides balloons balance sheet. Eyes on further government measures. Euro Forecast: More Gains on Way for EUR/USD, EUR/JPY, EUR/CHF? The Euro was surprisingly firm last week against a range of other major currencies, suggesting resilience in the face of poor economic data and a lack of confidence. US Dollar Correction in Play amid Failed Attempt to Test 2017 High The US Dollar index (DXY) may exhibit a bullish behavior over the remainder of the month as long as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) holds in overbought territory. Japanese Yen (JPY) Outlook: USD/JPY Poised For a Breakout The ‘V-shaped’ recovery in USD/JPY just failed to hit its target and is now moving lower again. Important support is now being tested. Oil Price Outlook: Crude Collapses into Downtrend Support / 18yr Low Oil prices have plummeted nearly 70% off the yearly highs with crude testing technical downtrend support. Here are the levels that matter on the WTI weekly chart. British Pound Technical Forecast: GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, EUR/GBP It was a big week for GBP/USD as Cable crushed shorts, rallying more than 1,000 pips off of last week’s lows. Gold Price Outlook Hinges on 2013 High After Best Week Since 2008 Gold prices surged in the best week since 2008, but it has yet to surpass peaks from 2013. If XAU/USD can clear resistance next week, the yellow metal could set course for 2012 highs.	USD
5e7c9e76bd21a016612b17aa	Dollar slips ahead of expected surge in U.S. jobless claims due to coronavirus	LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell further on Thursday ahead of key U.S. data that is expected to show a surge in unemployment benefit claims as companies lay off workers due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus. Investors welcomed the U.S. Senate’s passage of a $2 trillion stimulus package to offset the economic impact of the respiratory pandemic, but there are already indications that some American states will need more money for medical supplies. Economists polled by Reuters anticipate a rise in U.S. jobless claims by 1 million in the week to March 21 - an indicator of much the spread of the virus has affected the world’s largest economy. If the number meets market expectations, it would be well above the previous peak seen during the 2008 global financial crisis. The record before that was just a little under 700,000 in 1982 when the United States was going through a recession. Many analysts, however, have put the number between 1 million and 4 million. “The wide range of estimates, from around 1 million to 4 million, show that we lack historical references to really understand the impact of this unique and probably massive crisis hitting the economy,” said Christopher Dembik, head of macro analysis at Saxo Bank. The dollar shed 0.8% of its value against the euro to trade at $1.0979 EUR=EBS, a one-week low. It also lost 1.4% of its value versus the safe-haven Japanese yen and was last exchanging hands for 109.60 yen JPY=EBS, a six-day low. Analysts at MUFG said the common currency was also boosted by the fact that nine European Union countries including France, Italy and Spain have called for issuing joint bonds to help revive the euro zone economy from a deep slump caused by the coronavirus. However, Germany and the Netherlands will lead opposition to issuing the mutualized debt when the EU’s national leaders discuss emergency assistance later on Thursday. The $2 trillion U.S. package includes one-off payments to individuals, increased benefits for the unemployed and aid to companies, including loans and debt relief to small businesses, plus assistance to states and local governments. The United States also opened the taps for short-term dollar funding as the Federal Reserve swapped dollars for foreign currencies with other major central banks. This has helped to ease the cost of swapping three-month yen into dollars, which blew out to 144 basis points (bps) over interbank rates this month as stress in the dollar-funding market caused by the pandemic led to a shortage of the American currency. JPYCBS3M=ICAP “The Fed is winning the battle to get enough dollars into the global financial engine to keep it turning over. Demand for dollars through the Fed/BOJ swap line remains higher than in Europe, but the USD/JPY basis has now narrowed,” said Kit Juckes, macro strategist at Societe Generale. The three-month basis swap in dollar/yen was last at 49 bps. Elsewhere, sterling jumped 1% versus the dollar to $1.20 GBP=D3, an eight-day high, but was flat against the euro at 91.63 pence EURGBP=D3. The Australian and New Zealand dollars, both closely linked to the global commodity trade, were rising against their U.S. counterpart after falling during the Asian trading session.

5e94b77de7905f2276c65527	Aurora Cannabis plans 1-for-12 reverse stock split, to enhance liquidity with new at-the-market program	"Aurora Cannabis Inc. ACB, -0.98% ACB, -1.88% said Monday it is taking steps to improve liquidity and regain compliance with New York Stock Exchange listing requirements, after its stock traded below $1 for more than 30 days. The company said its board has approved a 1-for-12 reverse stock split scheduled for on or about May 11. The Canadian cannabis company had $205 million in cash at the end of March, including all amounts raised in an at-the-market (ATM) offering program initially announced in May of 2019. To bolster its balance sheet, the company is planning a renewed ATM program to raise additional equity capital on top the roughly $350 million that remains available under its outstanding shelf prospectus. ""The company intends to use a portion of this available capacity to provide further balance sheet strength and preserve flexibility given macroeconomic uncertainty caused by COVID-19,"" the company said in a statement. Aurora is on track with its previously announced business transformation plan, that includes reducing SG&A costs, cutting capex and simplifying its business structure. It is still expecting fiscal third-quarter cannabis net revenue to show ""modest growth"" compared with the second quarter. The company's Canadian and international facilities are fully operational and it is working with local, national and international authorities to ensure it is complying with guidelines on the pandemic. U.S.-listed shares were down 6% premarket and have fallen 59% in the year to date. The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ, +1.26% has fallen 33% and the S&P 500 SPX, +2.42% has fallen 14%. The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 rose above 22,000 on Monday, as President Donald Trump railed against the nation’s top infectious disease expert for suggesting more lives could have been saved if restrictions on movement had been imposed earlier.

5e81b594c496d2354de72fcb	Soft start to trading week; Greece elections, Erdogan fires CB head, Deutsche Bank restart, oil struggles, gold higher	Global equities are quietly softer across the board on softer than expected German data, follow through on Friday’s falling Fed rate cut blues, and a plethora or regional stories that added to the risk-off tone. Deutsche Bank’s mixed review on their radical overhaul, Erdogan’s sacking of his central bank chief, uncertainty on how quickly Iran will raise their nuclear enrichment program, and Morgan Stanley’s downgrade of investment guidance on global stocks are keeping markets in the red. US stocks markets will likely struggle to rebound until we hear from Fed chair Powell’s testimony to Congress on Wednesday. Markets are still confident the Fed will cut rates at the end of the month, but the strong labor market have many doubting the Fed will signal more rate cuts will come following a small 25 basis point cut at the end of July FOMC meeting. Financial markets are also waiting for a significant update on the trade front between the Chinese and Americans. If we do not see a meeting setup in Washington DC or Beijing soon, markets will grow nervous that a final deal will get pushed to next year and that uncertainty will derail fourth quarter earnings forecasts. Markets appear convinced the largest four central banks will be pumping up markets, but earnings season could see drastic fourth quarter forecasts downgrades if we don’t have more optimism on the trade front. Greece The populist movement is leaving Athens as Greece’s center-right New Democracy party leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis will become prime minister on Monday. The 51-year-old Mitsotakis victory shows markets that Greece is going back to supporting the main stream party. Outgoing Prime Minister Tsipras helped Greece get out of deep austerity measures that crippled the economy in 2015, but now with the economy in recovery mode, Greece is looking for someone deliver more market friendly measures. Mitsotakis won an outright majority in the snap general election. His business-friendly approach which will likely see him try to reduce taxes and privatize services in the country. He will likely seek to renegotiate budget surplus terms with the EU and that should be the beginning of a new struggle that ultimately should be positive for the Greek economy. Lira President Erdogan dismissal of Murat Cetinkaya, the head at the Turkish central bank (CBRT) was due to happen after central bank chief policy decisions disagreed that higher interest rates cause inflation. It is clear that central bank independence does not exist in Turkey and the lira will suffer. The Turkish president wants a low-interest rate policy put in place and the market has already priced in a major cut for its next policy meeting on July 25th. Before the firing the CBRT’s stance was to keep policy steady in the current tightening cycle as inflation continues to remain three times above their target. Erdogan is under growing pressure after losing the rerun mayoral race in Istanbul. Turkey’s recession is being blamed on Erdogan, who made the push for increased bank lending and public spending, only supporting a temporary relief in the economy. The political stimulus effects have faded, and the falling lira have dealt a strong blow to the Turkish economy. The lira is off the lows following the sacking, but that could be temporary, as many analysts view rate cuts as not enough to jump start the Turkey’s economy. Skepticism is also very high on the Erdogan’s appointment of Deputy Gov Murat Uysal. Banks that could see their Turkish assets struggle include Unicredit, BBVA, BNP Paribas and HSBC. Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank’s fifth restructuring program in four years will see the departure of the equities and trading business and a drastic reduction in costs which include the 18,000 layoffs by 2022. An overhaul, removal of the equities business, like this has not been attempted before and abandoning the global business to become a German bank only is not getting a strong vote of confidence on Monday. Oil Crude prices are struggling to stabilize even as Iran signals they will breach the levels of uranium enrichment under the 2015 nuclear accord. While the situation remains tense in the Middle East, crude is not surging as Europe and Iran are communicating and optimism is growing that we could see Europe deliver some relief to Tehran’s economy in exchange for upholding the nuclear accord. Crude is also looking heavy as the global demand picture remains ugly following softer than expected German industrial production data. The main event for financial markets this week is the Fed’s Powell testimony to Congress this week. Investors who are calling for a massive start to the easing cycle are nervous the blockbuster jobs report could have the Fed possibly wait till September. If Fed fund futures start to price in a growing risk that we will not see a cut this month, the dollar could rally, bring down commodity prices down across the board. Gold Gold is rising on softer than expected industrial production data from Germany, growing concern we will see major downgrades with fourth quarter outlooks this upcoming earnings season and nervousness Powell will not be dovish enough this week. With peak summer upon Wall Street, markets are likely to see lower volumes until we get to big events. Bitcoin Bitcoin remains stuck in the $11,000 to $12,000 range as the rally that stemmed from the revival in retail and institutional interest has run its course. Mainstream commerce is a lengthy project that eventually will provide consistent demand for cryptocurrencies, but for now we could see a little exhaustion in the crypto news space.

5e8af34eb8f4b766b0f0f2cd	Virus slowdown, dividend news helps FTSE	The new trading week started on a more optimistic note with the FTSE following the lead of its European peers and opening higher as the coronavirus spread started showing signs of levelling off. After weeks of weighty health news, investors were quick to grasp the opportunity to buy rather than sell, and the risers on the FTSE looked far more impressive than the losses. Topping the tables was plane engine maker Rolls Royce, rallying 16% as it became the latest company to scrap its targets and give up on paying out a dividend to protect itself through the coronavirus downturn. In contrast, Legal & General also rallied 16% after it said it would still pay out dividends at the end of the year despite the opposite advice from the Bank of England. There are still a few falling stocks on the index but their declines are all well below 1%. Among them are supermarkets, utilities and pharma companies, mostly stocks that benefitted from the extended UK lockdown. OPEC meeting Oil could see some volatility in the days ahead as OPEC members and Russia will discuss cutbacks in the face of evaporating global demand. The dispute between Saudi Arabia and Russia over who will produce more and who will produce less, will have to go on the backburner as the two countries face a bigger problem after Brent crude dropped below $30 in March. If OPEC+ does cut output today it is still a question of whether there is going to be much upside for oil prices, given President Trump's Thursday tweet on the topic had already caused prices to rally 30% last week.

5e83301b6e641510c6e95c0b	Dollar surges on quarter-end flows; outlook robust	LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar climbed against a swathe of currencies on Tuesday amid fiscal year-end demand by Japanese firms while the Australian dollar slipped despite a Chinese survey showing manufacturing returned to growth in March. Tuesday is the last trading day of Japan’s fiscal year and the end of the quarter for major investors elsewhere, which has fuelled some volatility as big currency market players closed their books. The bulk of those positioning changes caused the dollar to strengthen. “The talk is Japanese names are short of dollars, which is likely to keep the dollar bid well into London time,” said Yukio Ishizuki, FX strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. With news on the coronavirus front decidedly mixed as Italy reported its slowest rate of new confirmed cases in two weeks while the number of daily deaths in Spain jumped, investors resumed purchasing the dollar. Against a basket of six other currencies =USD, the dollar rose 0.7% to 99.88. It reached 102.99, its highest in more than three years, earlier this month as a global market selloff fuelled a rush for dollars. Dollar demand has ebbed, but analysts are still forecasting more dollar gains. For the quarter, the dollar was the biggest gainer =USD, rising 2.5%. The Norwegian crown was the biggest loser NOK=D3, falling 19% versus the greenback. “The dollar is still in demand despite pressure easing on risky assets and with liquidity far from average, the main thing to watch today should be month-end quarter-end rebalancing,” said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at financial services firm AxiCorp. The dollar rose 0.7% to 108.60 yen JPY=EBS on Tuesday. The Chinese yuan CNY=CFXS CNH=D3 was the only currency to buck the trend, holding firm against the dollar in both the onshore and the offshore market. China’s official manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index unexpectedly showed activity swung to expansion in March. China’s economy is still expected to see a large contraction in the first quarter. While the Chinese currency stood firm against the dollar, the Australian dollar weakened, down 1.3% percent to $0.609. The euro EUR=EBS fell 1% to $1.0927 and sterling GBP=D3 declined 0.6% to $1.2347. Broader market gauges of dollar funding and market volatility also declined from multi-year highs on Tuesday. Three-month currency swaps in euro-dollar EURCBS3M=ICAP flipped into a rare premium against the dollar. Those volatile moves are probably a function of quarter-end flows rather than pointing to any structural imbalances in the FX markets, according to Kenneth Broux, a currency strategist at Societe Generale in London.

5e5d31b7d3c8fc0aa1ab81db	USD/CAD: Elliott Wave Analysis And Forecast For 28/02/2020 – 06/03/2020	The pair USD/CAD remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a level of 1.3271. Main scenario: long positions should be considered from corrections above the level of 1.3271 with a target of 1.3564 – 1.3664. Alternative scenario: breakout and consolidation below the level of 1.3271 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.3201 – 1.3142. Analysis: On the D1 time frame, supposedly, a descending correction finished developing in the form of the second wave of senior level (2) and wave (3) has started forming. The first counter-trend wave of junior level 1 of (3) is forming as an impetus on the H4 time frame. Apparently, the fifth wave of junior level v of 1 is forming on the H1 time frame, with wave (iii) of v forming inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels 1.3564 – 1.3664. The level of 1.3271 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels 1.3201 – 1.3142.	CAD

As of writing, the pair was up 0.05% on a daily basis at 1.3908. Heightened concerns over weakening global energy demand amid coronavirus-related lockdowns continue to weigh on crude oil prices even after OPEC+ and other producers reached a deal to cut output by 9.7 million barrels per day. Ahead of the American Petroleum Institue's (API) Weekly Crude Oil Stock data, the barrel of West Texas Intermediate is erasing nearly 7% on the day at $20.80. On the other hand, the US Dollar Index (DXY) is falling for the fourth straight trading day on Tuesday to keep the pair's upside capped. The upbeat market mood as reflected by surging equity indexes in the US weighs on the safe-haven USD and keeps the DXY deep in the negative territory near 99.

5e5d090473d82f5acc8afcdf	DAX Plunges On Coronavirus Fears & Weak IFO Data	The DAX has joined global indices tanking 2.2% in early on Monday as the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak weighs on risk sentiment. At the time of writing the deadly virus had killed 80 people and over 2750 are infected. Chinese authorities have 17 cities, with 40 million inhabitants in lock down in an attempt to control the spread of the virus. IFO Data Disappoints Adding to Germany’s woes was IFO business confidence data,which undershot in January, printing at 95.9 vs expectations of 97. The IFO executives outlook index unexpectedly fell to 92.9, driven by dwindling prospects in the service sector and construction sector, sectors which had supported Europe’s largest economy in recent quarters. Perhaps the only positive from the report was that manufacturing continues on show signs of stabilization; whilst the sector is still shrinking it is doing so at a slower pace. All in all, the data has dashed hopes that rising optimism among companies would lead to a broader economic recovery. Instead the data sounds a warning bell for those expecting a solid rebound in German economic growth. Levels to watch: The DAX gapped lower on the open on Monday and the selloff is gathering steam as investors take risk off the table. The index has dropped through its 50 & 100 sma on 4-hour chart and is fast approaching its 200 sma at 13195 as the bears take control. Immediate support can be seen at today’s low of 13285, prior to 200 sma at 13195. A breakthrough here could open the doors to support at 13110 (low 8th Jan) before 12950 (low 6th Jan).

Currently, the Centers for Disease for Control and Prevention does not recommend that the public wear masks. “The idea of getting a much more broad, community-wide use of masks outside of the health-care setting is under very active discussion at the task force,” Fauci, one of the country’s top infectious disease experts, told CNN T, -3.77%. “The CDC group is looking at that very carefully.” “The thing that has inhibited that a bit is to make sure that we don’t take away the supply of masks from the health-care workers who need them,” he said. “But when we get in a situation when we have enough masks, I believe there will be some very serious consideration about broadening this recommendation of using masks. We’re not there yet, but we’re close.” “If, in fact, a person who may or may not be infected wants to prevent infecting someone else, one of the best ways to do that is with a mask,” Fauci told CNN’s Jim Acosta. “So perhaps that’s the way to go and again, I say Jim, that’s under very active consideration. As I say, we’ll be discussing it today, this afternoon, at the task force meeting.” The Moneyist: ‘All they care about is making money.’ My manager told me to remove my face mask at work. Do face masks work? Fauci suggested the one thing putting this change of policy on hold is the scarcity of masks in health-care settings. “You don’t want to take masks away from the health care providers who are in a real and present danger of getting infected,” Fauci added. “That would be the worst thing we do. If we have them covered, you could look back and say maybe we need to broaden this.” At the White House daily press briefing earlier this week, President Donald Trump was also asked if the general public should now be wearing non-medical face masks, and he too suggested there may be a change of direction on masks. “That’s certainly something we could discuss,” Trump replied. The president added, “It could be something like that for a limited period of time.” Telling the public to wear masks would be a U-turn for U.S. public health officials. In the early days of the coronavirus in the U.S., the CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Surgeon General all asked the public not to wear face masks unless they were unwell or caring for someone who was sick. A debate over masks has become increasingly heated in recent days. Previous research has concluded that face masks help reduce contagion by reducing the amount of droplets sprayed into the air during flu season; a Japanese-based study says this works when paired with vaccination, not an option in this case. This study says N95 medical-grade masks do help filter viruses that are larger than 0.1 micrometers. The coronavirus is 0.125 micrometers. Several Asian countries, including South Korea and Taiwan, where wearing face masks is relatively common, appear to have had more success “flattening the curve” more effectively than in countries like the U.S., Spain and Italy. But the World Health Organization and the CDC still say mask usage should be limited to people who have COVID-19 or those who work in hospitals.

5e87b01a360fb451028cfa00	3M hits back at Trump, says ceasing exports of N95 masks will have ‘opposite’ effect, humanitarian consequences	3M Co. responded Friday to criticism from President Donald Trump, saying the request to cease exports of much-needed N95 masks to fight the COVID-19 pandemic will not only have the “opposite” effect of what is needed, but also significant “humanitarian” consequences. The company, which makes safety, industrial and consumer products, including Post-it Notes and Scotch tape, as well as face masks, said that it has been working closely with the Trump administration to supply N95 respirators to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus, and appreciates the authorities in the Defense Production Act that were invoked on Thursday, but indicated that some of the administration’s requests could be counterproductive. For example, under the DPA, the administration requested 3M to cease exports of respirators made in the U.S. to Canada and Latin America. The company MMM, -2.98% said that would have “significant humanitarian implications” as 3M is a critical supplier to those countries. It would also likely provoke other countries to do the same, as some have already done. “If that were to occur, the net number of respirators being made available to the United States would actually decrease,” 3M said in a statement. “That is the opposite of what we and the Administration, on behalf of the American people, both seek.” The company pointed out that after a request from the administration to increase respirators imported from its overseas operations, it was able to secure approval from the Chinese government, with help from the administration, to export 10 million N95 respirators that it made in China to the U.S. The company’s response comes after Trump tweeted late Thursday that he “hit 3M hard,” and that the company will have a “big price to pay,” as many in his administration were surprised with what 3M was doing with their masks. The administration formally invoked the DPA to require 3M to prioritize orders from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for N95 masks. Earlier this week, 3M said it has boosted production of N95 masks to 100 million per month, including 35 million masks per month in the U.S. By June, the company said it expected to make 50 million masks in the U.S. In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Chief Executive Mike Roman said it was “absurd” for President Trump to suggest 3M wasn’t doing everything it could to supply face masks to U.S. health-care workers. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” Roman said on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” program. Using the DPA to ask 3M to make more masks “may not be as effective as we wish,” as the shortage of masks is more a result of a lack of raw materials than of production capacity, according to Howard Yu, Lego professor of management and innovation at the Institute for Management Development in Switzerland. The raw material to make the N95 masks isn’t usually in high demand during peacetime, Yu said. “It requires once-obscure melt-blown fabric, an extremely fine mesh of synthetic polymer fibers,” Yu said. Yu said the administration also has to be careful in it’s attempt to fight the pandemic in isolation by calling for a cease in exports of personal protective equipment (PPE). “No country can be completely self-sufficient,” Yu said. “The virus knows no border.” Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reinforced that point in an interview on CTV News. He said 3M has indicated that it understands how important it is to continue with delivering on orders to places like Canada, “because there is much trade that goes back and forth in essential services and it can end up hurting Americans as much as it hurts anybody else.” 3M’s stock MMM, -2.98% fell 3.0% to close at $133.79, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.68% fell 361 points, or 1.7%. Year to date, 3M shares have shed 24.2% while the Dow has dropped 26.2%. Despite the boost in production in masks, from 3M and others, there is still expected to be an alarming shortfall. As reported in The Wall Street Journal, 3M and a half-dozen smaller competitors were producing about 50 million N95 masks in the U.S. each month, compared with the Department of Health and Human Services’ estimate in March that U.S. health-care workers would need 300 million masks. See related: Ford partners with GE, 3M to build ventilators, COVID-19 protective equipment. And demand for face masks are likely to increase substantially after Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, appear to be close to recommending the general public wear face masks. Don’t miss: Anthony Fauci: White House Coronavirus Task Force is giving ‘serious consideration’ to suggesting Americans wear face masks. Mayor Bill de Blasio advised New York City residents to cover their faces before leaving their homes, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said it “couldn’t hurt” to wear homemade face masks to stop the spread of coronavirus. Earlier this week, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker worked out a deal with New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft to fly 1.2 million N95 masks from China to the U.S., with 300,000 of that supply going to New York. Read the WSJ story of the details of the flight on the Patriots’ team plane. Last month, Cuomo had called on local fashion designers to help produce PPE, including face masks and hospital gowns, and they listened, with many designers, including New York’s Christian Siriano, Prabal Gurung and Rachel Comey, among others, announcing plans to join the fight of the COVID-19 pandemic. Read more in Barron’s. The supply of masks isn’t the only issue. On Friday, 3M said it will continue to fight against price gouging and the unauthorized reselling of its masks. “This activity is unethical and illegal,” 3M said. “We are working with the U.S. Attorney General and attorneys general of every state, making it clear that 3M has not and will not raise prices for respirators and offering our assistance in the fight.” Don’t miss: Biggest maker of medical face masks in the U.S. is warning of an outbreak...of fraud. ‘Even small mistakes that I might make could be huge for me.’ Tomi Kilgore is MarketWatch's deputy investing and corporate news editor and is based in New York.

5e93bc8b1c9a1e120bd9bc3e	Commodity currencies slip as OPEC+ output cuts provide little cheer	TOKYO (Reuters) - Commodity currencies slipped against safe-haven units such as the dollar and yen on Monday as a record output cut agreed by OPEC and other oil producing nations failed to offset broader concerns about global demand for resources. The greenback drifted higher against its Australian and New Zealand counterparts, which are seen as risk sentiment barometers, in a sign investors remain concerned about the global demand for commodities. Financial markets remain on edge over the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic as severe restrictions on personal movement drag the global economy into a deep recession. “The initial reaction suggests that the decline in oil demand is well ahead of the output cuts that were agreed,” said Yukio Ishizuki, FX strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. “This is a negative for oil producers. This also encourages risk-off trading, which should support the yen.” The dollar rose 0.24% against the Norwegian crown NOK=D3 to 10.21 and 0.44% to 23.43 Mexican pesos MXN=D3. Against the Canadian dollar CAD=D3, the U.S. currency held steady at C$1.3965. Trading could be somewhat subdued as financial markets in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Britain are closed for the Easter Monday holiday. Major oil producers agreed to the output cuts on Sunday to prop up oil markets amid the coronavirus pandemic. Oil prices had gone into freefall on worries about the virus and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, which was seen straining the budgets of oil producers and hammering the U.S. shale industry. Currencies from Norway, Mexico, and Canada - all major oil producers - got a boost on Friday as the agreement to cut output began to take shape, but these gains disappeared on Monday as investors avoided risk assets. While oil futures erased early losses to trade higher in Asia, currency markets showed some investors remain concerned about excessive risk. Other currency traders pointed to a decline in U.S. stock futures as a supportive factor for risk-off trades. The cautious mood boosted the yen, which is sometimes sought as a safe-haven because of Japan’s current account surplus. The yen JPY=EBS rose 0.18% to 108.31 per dollar in Asia on Monday and jumped more than 0.3% against the Australian AUDJPY= and New Zealand currencies NZDJPY=. Against the safe-haven Swiss franc CHF=EBS, the greenback held steady at 0.9656. The dollar traded at $1.0936 per euro EUR=EBS, near its lowest level in more than a week. Further declines in the dollar may be limited with speculative net short positions in the U.S. currency having risen to their highest since May 2018, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. The Australian dollar AUD=D3 fell 0.29% to $0.6329, pulling back from a four-week high, while the New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 fell 0.21% to $0.6072 as investors shunned risky trades.

5e65831e9c34d97054516684	Japan stocks drop 5%, China and Hong Kong shares plunge beyond 3% amid oil price war	"Stocks in Asia saw steep declines on Monday as oil prices plunged amid fears of a price war after OPEC failed to strike a deal with its allies on production cuts, adding to volatility already brought about by fears surrounding the coronavirus spread. The Nikkei 225 in Japan fell 5.07% to close at 19,698.76, while the Topix was down 5.61% to end its trading day at 1,388.97. Mainland Chinese stocks saw sharp declines on the day, with the Shanghai composite down 3.01% to about 2,943.29 while the Shenzhen component shed 4.09% to 11,108.55. The Shenzhen composite slipped 3.786% to around 1,842.66. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index plunged 4.23% to close at 25,040.46. South Korea's Kospi also dropped 4.19% to close at 1,954.77. Stocks in Australia tanked, with the S&P/ASX 200 down 7.33% to close at 5,760.60. Overall, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index fell 4.97%. The moves came as the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell below 0.5%, last trading at 0.4426%. The 30-year Treasury yield also hit a record low, breaching the 1% threshold for the first time in history, last trading at 0.8569%. The Japanese yen, often seen as a safe-haven currency, traded at 102.37 per dollar after seeing levels above 108 last week. Gold prices rose in the afternoon of Asian trading hours. Spot gold was 0.36% higher at $1,679.90 per ounce after earlier crossing $1,700 per ounce. U.S. futures also saw sharp declines on Monday morning stateside. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1,255 points, pointed to an opening loss on Monday of about 1,300 points. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures also pointed to declines for the two indexes when they open on Monday. ""The uncomfortable truth ... for a lot of investors is that there's really nowhere easy to hide,"" Bill Maldonado, Asia Pacific chief investment officer at HSBC Global Asset Management, told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" on Monday. ""If you look at all the traditional kind of low-risk, risk-free assets, they're already very expensive,"" Maldonado said. Oil prices were watched by investors on Monday. In the afternoon of Asian trading hours, the international benchmark Brent crude futures contract fell 22.91% to $34.90 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures also fell sharply by 24.71% to $31.08 per barrel. Shares of oil companies also saw sharp losses. Australia's Santos plunged 27.01% while Beach Energy dropped 19.39%. In Japan, Japan Petroleum Exploration fell 12.69%. Hong Kong-listed stocks of PetroChina and CNOOC plummeted 9.63% and 17.23%, respectively. The moves came after Saudi Arabia announced massive discounts on Saturday to its official selling prices for April, with the kingdom reportedly preparing to increase its production above the 10 million barrel per day mark, according to Reuters. Saudi Arabia's price cut followed a breakdown of talks in Vienna last week between OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, during a Friday meeting. The cartel had recommended additional production cuts on Thursday, but that was rejected by OPEC ally Russia on Friday. The meeting also concluded with no directive about the production cuts that are currently in place, but set to expire at the end of the month. That effectively meant that nations will soon have free rein over how much they pump. ""OPEC+ alliance looks dead after OPEC failed to reach an agreement with Russia on further production cuts,"" Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari, commodity strategists at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, wrote in a note dated Mar. 9. Hynes and Kumari said the current production cuts ""managed to support prices by keeping the market relatively balanced through a tumultuous period in the oil market."" ""We now see the likelihood of production rising from OPEC+ members relatively high, even before the agreement (officially) expires,"" they said. ""Russia stands out as the most likely to ramp up in the short term. Some of the smaller OPEC producers are also expected to raise output."" The worries over oil prices come as investors have already been jittery over the global spread of the coronavirus that has infected more than 106,000 and taken at least 3,639 lives worldwide, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization. Chinese trade data released over the weekend showed the country's January-February overseas shipments contracting 17.2% from the same period a year before, marking the steepest fall since February 2019, according to Reuters. Analysts polled by Reuters had projected a 14% drop as the coronavirus outbreak disrupted supply chains and dampened demand. Reuters also reported that China reported a trade deficit of $7.09 billion for the period, versus an expected surplus of $24.6 billion. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was last at 95.007 after earlier touching a low of 94.725. The Australian dollar changed hands at $0.6547 after an earlier low of $0.6318. In economic news, Japan's economy shrank an annualized 7.1% in October-December, according to data from Japan's Cabinet Office released Monday. That was a larger decline than the first preliminary estimate of a 6.3% annualized shrinkage. It was also worse than economists' median forecast of a 6.6% contraction and the biggest fall since April-June 2014, according to Reuters. — CNBC's Pippa Stevens and Christine Wang contributed to this report."

5e95a375f9876d66619d60d3	EUR/USD: Recovery remains in process [Video]	Overview: Risk appetites have returned today after taking yesterday off. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced every day last week, slipped yesterday, and jumped back today. Most of the national benchmark advanced at least 1.5%, and the Nikkei led the way with a 3% rally to reach its best level since mid-March. European markets re-opened after the long weekend. Last week's four-day rally is being extended today by almost 1% in the European morning. US shares are firm, and the S&P 500 loos set to recoup most of yesterday's decline. Benchmark yields are mostly higher. Italian bonds are eight basis points higher while peripheral yields are 3-4 bp higher. The US 10-year yield is a little below 75 bp. Rekindled risk appetites remove some demand for US dollars, and the greenback is mixed. It is a little heavier against the dollar-bloc currencies. Although the South African rand has appreciated and eastern and central European currencies are mostly firmer, the JP Morgan Emerging Market Currency Index is a little heavier for the second session after rising every day last week. Gold is holding above $1700, and May WTI is softer and struggling to stay above $22 a barrel. Singapore, South Korea, and China have seen new flare-ups of infections, and several countries in Asia and Europe are extending their lockdowns. China reported the highest number of new daily cases in almost six weeks on Sunday (108). The overwhelming majority of new cases are reportedly traced to people returning to China from abroad. Roughly half the new cases traceable to Russia and Chinese cites near the border indicated they would tighten border controls and quarantine measures (28 days in quarantines and nucleic and antibody tests) on new arrivals. China reported a $19.90 bln trade surplus in March. It had recorded a combined deficit of $7.1 bln in the January-February period. Exports fell by 6.6% (in dollar terms), which is less than half the decline expected and a little less than a third of the decline reported in the first two months of the year. Exports to the EU (-24.2%), the US (-20.8%) and Japan (-1.4%) fell. Imports eased by a little less than 1%. Economists had expected a decline closer to 10%. Imports from the US fell 12.5% and from the EU 6.5%. Imports from ASEAN and Japan rose (10.5% and 4.8%) respectively. Those looking for insight into progress meeting the US trade deal will note that agriculture imports from the US rose 110% in Q1, led by a more than 200% increase in soy purchases. China imported nearly three times more pork in March (391k tons) than March 2019. Pork imports in Jan-Feb were more than double the comparable 2019 figures. Separately, the surge in integrated circuit imports (~43.5% after a 10.5% decline in Jan-Feb) appears to reflect the return to manufacturing and assembly of electronic goods as the economy re-starts. Just like it makes little sense for the US to be so dependent on China for some types of medicine and rare earths, it makes little sense for China to be dependent on foreign chip makers. We have noted Japan's exports of semiconductor fabrication equipment to China. Now one of China's chipmakers (Yangtze Memory Technologies) claims to have the capability to build the most advanced chips (128-layer 3D NAND flash memory chips). Presently, the 96-layer 3D NAND is being done by global players, but the 128-layer is the next generation. The dollar broke below JPY108 yesterday and has unable to resurface the area today. There is an option for about $760 mln that is struck there that will expire today. Support is seen closer to JPY107.00, and an option for $1.1 bln at JPY107.05 will be cut today. The Australian dollar pushed through $0.6400 to extend its streak to the seventh session. When the rally began, the Aussie was below $0.6000. The $0.6450 area corresponds to a (61.8%) retracement of this year's decline. Initial support is pegged near $0.6370. The technical indicators are getting stretched and caution against chasing the market at these levels. The PBOC set the dollar's reference rate a little above CN7.04 today, though the bank models implied something closer to CNY7.0375. The dollar is back into the CNY7.05-CNY7.12 range. We note that Indonesia's central bank defied expectations and left the key rate steady at 4.5%. The rupiah is steady after falling about 3.8% in the past two sessions. While France is extending the lockdown to May 11 and the UK expected to extend its to May 11, Austria is one of the first countries to ease restrictions. Italy had extended its lockdown at the end of last week into early May. Spain reported the fewest new cases in three weeks, and Germany reported a decline in infections for the fifth day. There is some concern that the numbers may have been depressed by the long holiday weekend, so the reports in the coming days are needed for confirmation. The euro is trading quietly inside yesterday's range (~$1.0895-$1.0970). It has been confined to less than a quarter-cent range on either side of $1.0925. There appears to be near-term potential toward $1.10, where an option for 733 mln euros will expire today. Sterling finally pushed above $1.25 yesterday, after first testing it in late March. Former resistance has now become support, and sterling has held above $1.25 today. It reached $1.2575, for the first time since March 13, when it traded as high as $1.2625. Above there, the 200-day moving average is near $1.2655. The technical readings are getting stretched. Two groups of states, one on the West Coast (California, Oregon, and Washington) and one on the East Coast (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Deleware, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts) are trying to coordinate the re-opening of the economies. Together the nine states account for about a third of US GDP and 105 mln people. The press is playing up the conflict with the White House as the President claims complete authority. We suspect the drama may not be so great. The White House deferred to the states for shutdowns and will likely provide only broad guidelines as local containment varies greatly throughout the country. Moreover, if some lockdowns are needed again, as has been the case in several Asian countries, better that local officials have discretion. Recognizing an easing of market tensions, the Federal Reserve announced it would reduce the frequency of its repo operations starting May 4. It would conduct one, not two overnight repo operations a day. The three-month term repo would be held once every two weeks rather than weekly. The one-month operation would continue on a weekly basis. The maximum amount was unchanged at $500 bln. Texas regulators are expected to meet today to decide if the US will join OPEC+ and make additional cuts in output. Those that want to as thought to be in the minority. The signals from the White House suggest market forces alone will do the job. The US reports import/export prices today, which do not garner much market attention even in the best of times. The US earnings season starts today before the equity open with JP Morgan and Wells Fargo reports. While trading revenue may have risen, there is concern that debt will be marked down as borrowers struggle in the shutdown. Meanwhile, recall that LIBOR eased last Thursday, the last time it was set, by 9 bp, the most in a month, to a hair below 1.22%. It remains elevated, and further easing is anticipated as the Fed's commercial paper facility is launched today. The Fed's Bostic, Bullard, and Evans speak today ahead of the Beige Book report due tomorrow. The US dollar fell to almost CAD1.3855 yesterday, its lowest level since mid-March, but has stabilized today. It is reaching the session high near CAD1.3920 in late European morning turnover. Above there, and the greenback encounters resistance in the CAD1.3960-CAD1.3980 area. A move back through CAD1.40 would suggest a near-term low is in place. The US dollar is consolidating against the Mexican peso inside yesterday's range (~MXN23.2460-MXN23.8660). A break of that range will likely point the near-term direction. Broadly speaking, the peso appears more correlated with the general risk appetite (S&P 500 proxy) than oil prices.	USD
5e8d9a452e5d81766b33c335	Sterling edges lower as dollar dominates	LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling edged lower against the dollar on Wednesday, as demand for the U.S. currency rose broadly amid growing concerns in markets that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over. Earlier in the week, the pound saw knee-jerk reactions to news around the condition of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who - having tested positive for the coronavirus - was admitted to hospital and then moved to intensive care. He was last reported to be in stable condition. (GRAPHIC: Trading sideways - here) Overall, sterling has traded sideways versus the dollar over the last week and a half, as risk sentiment gyrates while the crisis evolves. “The pound’s been pulled around by external factors at the moment - largely the broader risk and dollar environment - with key themes in equities and oil markets driving FX sentiment,” said Viraj Patel, global FX and macro strategist at Arkera. “We’ve seen a couple of knee-jerk moves lower on the headlines over PM Johnson being in hospital. But these have faded quickly, with the short squeeze and positioning adjustment in high-beta currencies dominating FX markets,” Patel added. By 0830 GMT, the pound was 0.24% lower at $1.2303, but gained against a broadly weaker euro to trade 0.1% higher at 88.20 pence. Economic data in the UK added to the gloom. British employers’ demand for staff plummeted in March with job vacancies contracting for the first time in nearly 11 years as the coronavirus pandemic brought hiring activity to a halt, a survey of recruiters showed. Britain’s markets watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority set out temporary measures to help companies raise cash quickly to get through the epidemic. But only a small fraction of British companies have successfully accessed financial help from the government to withstand the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, while scores more have failed so far, a survey showed.

It was the largest initial claims weekly filing in U.S. history and something I’d imagine no one ever thought they would see in their lifetime. Later today, at 8:30am ET, the U.S. will release Initial Claims for the week ending March 28th. The expectation is for 3,500,000, with continuing claims expected to be 4,882,000! If the figure comes in close to expectations, that would be a 2-week total of almost 6,800,000 filing for unemployment claims in the last 2 weeks. As the country continues to shut down, state by state, these numbers are likely to continue at this rate for the next month. President Trump said the earliest the U.S. would “reopen” would be April 30th. Yesterday, ADP released their Nonfarm Employment Change for March. The figure was -27,000 vs an expectation of -150,000. Tomorrow, the U.S. releases Nonfarm Payroll data. Expectations are for a change of -100,000 jobs. The unemployment rate is expected to uptick from 3.5% to 3.8%. The unemployment data overall is likely to get worse before it gets better. However, as initial claims is the most up- to-date data released, it will also be the number most focused on. All of this comes as President Trump recently said that the U.S. expects 100,000 to 240,000 deaths from the coronavirus. He stated yesterday that “we are going to have a couple weeks that will be horrific in coronavirus task force daily press briefings.” Last Thursday, the day of the initial claims data release, the DXY sold off 1.5% from 100.26 to 99.46. It has since been consolidating between 98.27 and just below horizontal resistance at 99.91. This is also the area between the 38.2% and 61.8% retracement levels from the March 9th low to the March 20th highs. If the initial claims data is weak, and the DXY sells off like it did last week, price could be down near 97.00 by the end of the day. The targeted move out of the pennant formation is near 95, or almost a 100% retracement back to the March 9th lows. If the initial claims data is better, price could break out to the upside and trade near horizontal resistance at 101. However regardless of the actual figure released, it will still be bad. And as the President has recently expressed, things are likely to remain dire for at least the next few weeks. Original Post	USD
5e5e7bafb77406216f784bf7	Apple Back Out of “Bear Market” Territory	Markets have been a rollercoaster over the past couple of weeks, and no megacap stock has seen a wilder ride than Apple (AAPL). At this time less than two weeks ago, the technology and consumer electronic company was trading near $325, within 1% of its record high, and had a market capitalization in excess of $1.4T. As fears of supply chain disruptions in China and falling demand across the globe spread, the stock saw its own “bear market,” shedding over -21% as of Friday’s open to trade below $260 with a market capitalization of “only” about $1.1T. In just two weeks, Apple’s market cap declined by about $300B, the approximate value of Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla (TSLA)…combined! The AAPL rollercoaster made a sharp reversal Friday, rallying nearly 7% off the lows to close near flat before tacking on another 9% yesterday. With the stock now trading back near $300 again, equity traders around the globe are asking: Where will AAPL go next? From a fundamental perspective, coronavirus will undoubtedly take a big bite out of Apple’s business. As the revenue breakdown below shows, the company still derives about 80% of its sales from products like the iPhone (52%), Mac (11%), wearables/other (10%), and iPads (7%), despite the rapid growth in the company’s services division: Source: MacRumors.com The majority of these products are manufactured in China and will therefore be vulnerable to shortages and supply chain delays through at least the first half of the year. On the other side of the equation, demand for Apple’s products will also see a temporary hit as consumers retrench and cut discretionary spending. That said, any downshift in demand will likely be temporary. Just because a person can’t get ahold of the newest iPhone in March doesn’t mean they’ll never upgrade; instead, they’ll merely postpone their purchase until April or May. In other words, the current coronavirus fears represent a significant near-term headwind for the stock, but the long-run impact will likely be limited. Indeed, it could serve as an opportunity for the company to diversify its heavily China-dependent supply chain, making it more resistant to future disruptions in the region. So far, analysts are “looking through” the company’s current issues, with a median price target of $338 based on 11 analysts who have issued a recommendation on the stock in the last 3 months according to Nasdaq. From a technical perspective, traders were briefly granted an opportunity that’s been relatively rare of late: the chance to buy AAPL near its 200-day exponential moving average. While the stock did break below its near-term bullish trend line and shorter-term 20- and 50-day EMAs, it found support at the 200-day EMA, similar to the drop we saw last August: Source: TradingView, GAIN Capital Put simply, the stock’s longer-term uptrend remains intact for the moment, despite the recent swoon. The late-February drop alleviated Apple’s persistent bearish divergence with its RSI indicator, potentially clearing the way for another leg higher in the weeks to come. Meanwhile, the stock continues to outperform the broader S&P 500 index, showing relative strength even amidst the company’s somewhat idiosyncratic supply chain issues. While we’re skeptical of the potential for an immediate “V-shaped” reversal back to new highs, a period of consolidation near current levels would be seen as a bullish sign (and of course, we could be wrong; we’ve underestimated the market’s “buy the dip” mentality in the past!). At this point, only a break below Friday’s intraday low and the 200-day EMA near $255 would call the longer-term uptrend into question.	USD
5e960a8d04c89b7b3879d680	USD/JPY: All eyes on 107.00 this week	Despite (or perhaps because of) signs of coronavirus “curve flattening” in the US, the greenback is among the day’s weakest major currencies. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen is holding up relatively well for a traditional safe haven currency on a generally “risk on” day (stocks up, bond yields down, gold flat). A quick look at the USD/JPY daily chart reveals that this weak USD / strong JPY pattern has been playing out over the last week, taking the pair down from the mid-109.00s to test support near 107.00 as of writing: As the chart above shows, the RSI indicator has already broken below its equivalent low from the start of the month, signaling that the selling pressure has grown over the last two weeks and that rates may be more likely to follow the indicator lower in the coming days. If USD/JPY does break support, bears may look to target the Fibonacci retracements of the March rally at 106.45 (50%), 105.20 (61.8%), and 103.45 (78.6%) next. On the other hand, if bulls can defend that line in the sand, the pair could bounce toward 108.00 or 109.00 by early next week. Fundamentally speaking, the US retail sales report morning and initial unemployment claims on Thursday will be the key updates on the economic front over the rest of the week. Of course, traders remain hyper-focused on coronavirus news, especially regarding economies “restarting,” so that’s likely to trump (no pun intended!) any traditional economic data releases.	JPY
5e7bbd7c1f2a985a8ee7389b	Dollar drops as U.S. stimulus bill boosts risk-taking	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies on Wednesday as a $2 trillion stimulus bill helped boost risk appetite, and reduced demand for the safe haven currency. Stocks surged for a second day as U.S. senators were due to vote on a bipartisan package of legislation to alleviate the devastating economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, hoping it will become law quickly. Investors are also likely reducing dollar exposure ahead of Thursday’s jobless claims data, which is expected to show a surge in Americans filing for benefits as businesses close across the country in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. “Today’s developments are a good excuse to pare back on bullish bets on the dollar,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions, in Washington. “But sentiment is still positive (for the dollar) as uncertainty remains high about the economic damage from the virus.” New York’s governor on Wednesday said there were tentative signs that restrictions were slowing the spread of the coronavirus in his state, even as the public health crisis deepened in hard-hit New Orleans and other parts of the United States. Jobless claims on Thursday are expected to rise to around a million, from 281,000 the previous week, according to the median estimate from a Reuters poll of economists. The dollar index fell 0.81% to 101.87. Sterling jumped 1.33% to $1.1913. The euro gained 0.91% versus the greenback to $1.0885. The single currency was also boosted after the German lower house on Wednesday suspended the country’s constitutionally enshrined debt brake, approving a massive stimulus package by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government. Germany’s economy could contract by as much as 20% this year due to the impact of the coronavirus, an Ifo economist said on Wednesday, as German business morale tumbled to its lowest level since the global financial crisis in 2009. Investors are also continuing to absorb the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented announcement on Monday that it would launch unlimited quantitative easing, and how that will impact the greenback. “QE was first introduced back in 2008, the dollar initially weakened but then recovered to even stronger levels. We believe that dynamic will likely unfold now,” said Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.

5e81b63dc496d2354de7306c	Dollar Looking for Economic Guidance Ahead of Busy Week	The US dollar is higher against most major pairs on Friday ahead of the G20 meeting. The greenback fell across the board on Wednesday after the market took the comments from Fed Chair Powell on interest rates to mean less rate hikes from the central bank. The minutes form the November Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) showed all members are onboard with more rates hikes coming “very soon” but the dovish narrative was in full force and the dollar only partially recovered to end up slightly higher against major pairs on a weekly basis. Dollar Higher on Risk Aversion The EUR/USD fell 0.67 percent on Friday as risk aversion ahead of the weekend favoured the US dollar. The single currency is trading at 1.1316 awaiting the outcome of the G20 meeting in Argentina. Previous meeting of global leaders have ended in stalemates and clearly show not everybody is on the same page. There have been signs of both China and the United States willing to cooperate and reduce tariffs, but they have come with an equal measure of escalation of trade disputes. Uncertainty is high as a week full of economic indicator rebased and geopolitical risks will end on Friday with the release of the U.S. non farm payrolls (NFP). The U.S. Federal Reserve has hiked 3 times in 2018 and the market estimates another interact rate lift on December 19. The CME FedWatch tool shows a 82.7 percent probability of a rate hike despite the comments from Fed members. The US central bank is expected to slowdown its monetary policy tightening in 2019, but will finish the year with a 25 basis point lift after every major FOMC. The US economic calendar will kick off on Monday, December 3 with the release of the ISM Manufacturing PMI forecasted to slowdown slightly to 57.5. Non-Manufacturing PMI will follow on Wednesday along the release of the ADP private payrolls report. Friday, December 7 the U.S. non farm payrolls (NFP) will be posted with another big jobs gain expected, and a 0.3 percent average hourly earnings gain. Loonie Falls Despite USMCA Signing The Canadian dollar is lower on Friday against the US dollar. The USD/CAD gained 0.08 percent on Friday to put the loonie down 0.47 percent versus the greenback on the last week of November. Lower oil prices and a perceived slowdown of the economy could mean the Bank of Canada (BoC) remains data dependant and pushes back plans to raise interest rates until spring although there is still a 70 percent probability priced in for a January rate hike. Canadian Prime Minister was joined by US President Donald Trump and outgoing Mexican President Pena Nieto to sign the USMCA with the G20 as the background. Trade is a big topic for discussion at the meeting, with a likely outcome of no deal reached between China and the United States. Canada is not immune to trade uncertainty despite renewing its partnership with the US and Mexico. Oil prices fell on Friday and the market will focus on the outcome of the meeting between the OPEC and other major producers to once again agree on a crude production cut to stem the drop in energy prices. November Blues for Oil as Oversupply is Balanced Against Production Cut Plans Oil prices have plummeted more than 20 percent during November. Weather and geopolitical factors have disrupted supply, but as supply has recovered and in the case of Iran, waivers were issued, oversupply concerns took over pushing prices lower. Russia has not committed to a new agreement to limit production. The deal with OPEC and other major producers stabilized prices, but as the US President pressures Saudi Arabia to keep prices low it must look to its own best interests. Trade disputes have also impacted energy prices as global growth estimates have been slashed as more protectionist measures are introduced. Higher supply with shrinking demand have resulted in lower crude prices, with the OPEC trying to tackle the first part of the equation. The second production cut agreement is not a done deal at this point and comments from Russia do not hint at a strong commitment at this stage. Gold Lower as Dollar Riding Risk Aversion Wave The yellow metal ended November flat as risk events kept the commodity bid, while trade concerns and monetary policy boosted the US dollar. Gold has rejoined investor’s portafolio as a safe haven, but still struggles to overcome its weakness against the US dollar as US triggered trade aversion has made the greenback the de facto refuge. The U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to hike in December with economic indicators validating the decision as US jobs and inflation continue to advance. Next year is a bigger question mark as the Fed will not be able to hike four times as in 2018 and the economy is expected to cool down. Gold is forecasted to trade higher next year as risk will remain, but the dollar will lose the support from the central bank.

5e6af7c646d0bf62290340d0	Dollar wins out as pandemic drives rush for liquid assets	TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar stood tall on Friday as investors scrambled for the world’s most liquid currency amid deepening panic about the coronavirus while the euro nursed losses after the European Central Bank disappointed investors by not cutting rates. The greenback held gains against most currencies after a blowout in swap spreads showed investors are facing a shortage of dollars as equity markets plunged on fears about the economic impact of the flu-like virus. The ECB on Thursday unveiled a stimulus package that provides loans to banks with rates as low as minus-0.75% and increases bond purchases. The Federal Reserve moved to provide $1.5 trillion in short-term liquidity and changed the durations of Treasuries it buys, but money markets show investors expect the Fed will have to go even further to restore calm to financial markets. Italy, which has become Europe’s hot spot for coronavirus infections, has effectively put its entire country on lockdown to try to slow the virus. Investors have so far expressed disappointment with the government response to rising infections in the United States, and traders warn there could be more disruptions in a broad range of financial markets. “Risk off used to benefit the yen, but now we see that risk off is supporting the dollar,” said Takuya Kanda, general manager of the research department at Gaitame.com Research Institute in Tokyo. “We are in panic mode, because we don’t know how far stocks will fall.” The euro EUR=EBS traded at $1.1181, following a 0.72% decline on Thursday in the wake of the ECB decision. For the week the common currency was on course for a 0.9% decline. Against the pound GBP=D3 the dollar eased slightly to $1.2585 in Asia on Friday, but that followed its biggest one-day gain against sterling since July 2016. The greenback was also strong against the Swiss franc CHF=EBS, trading at 0.9450 following a 0.7% gain on Thursday. The ECB rolled out yet another stimulus package on Thursday to help fight off the coronavirus pandemic did not join its counterparts in the United States and Britain by cutting rates. Investors, who had bet the ECB could cut rates at least 10 basis points and possibly more, were disappointed. ECB President Christine Lagarde also aggravated a market selloff by saying it was not the central bank’s job to close the spread between the borrowing costs of various members, comments which she later tried to roll back. Authorities are rushing to introduce travel bans, extra financial liquidity and monetary easing as the rapid spread of the virus across the world slams the brakes on the global economy.The dollar held steady at 104.62 yen JPY=EBS, on course for its third weekly decline. With signs of financial stress emerging across different markets, the New York Federal Reserve said it would make the money available in three tranches of $500 billion each and that it would start purchasing a broader range of U.S. Treasury securities. The Fed meets next week and many analysts now expect the central bank to chop its own target policy rate, quite possibly to zero, and give markets new guidance about how it plans to combat the economic fallout from the coronavirus. Cross-currency basis swap spreads for the yen JPYCBS3M= and the pound GBPCBS3M=ICAP blew out on Thursday in what traders say is a sign of a dollar shortage. Highlighting the sense of crisis, senior officials from the Group of Seven talked on Thursday and confirmed they will cooperate closely as equities tumble and corporate bond spreads widen. Elsewhere in currencies, the Australian AUD=D3 and New Zealand dollars NZD=D3 managed to bounce more than half a percent against the greenback in Asian trade. The antipodeans were mauled on Thursday as investors shunned riskier currencies that are linked to the global commodities trade. Reporting by Stanley White; Editing by Sam Holmes	EUR
5e94d01387720a2403053225	Dollar index ticks lower in thin trade	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar index inched lower in thin afternoon trade with Europe out on holiday for Easter Monday. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six rival currencies, was down 0.09%. Against the euro, the dollar was 0.19% stronger at $1.091. “The dollar rallied some overnight in holiday thinned trade, though pulled back in light N.Y. trade on Monday. There was zero data on tap, and focus largely remained on virus developments,” wrote analysts at Action Economics. The number of coronavirus-related U.S. deaths reported on Sunday was 1,513, the smallest increase since April 6. The largest number of fatalities is still in and around New York, the most populous U.S. city with about 8.4 million people. Financial markets remain on edge over the spread of the novel coronavirus as severe restrictions on personal movement drag the global economy into a deep recession. However, a slower news flow in the past few days has boosted risk assets modestly, and the safe-haven dollar has drifted modestly lower. The greenback has also been pressured in the last few weeks by Federal Reserve measures that have flooded the financial system with dollars to address a liquidity crunch caused in part by demand for the U.S. currency. “As we leave the acute phase of the crisis, the market will have to deal with the underlying data and the uncertainty of the CV-19 exit strategies. The latter will be piecemeal and bumpy. It’s a dance of fits and starts rather than a binary event of economy on/off. In turn, we expect another bump in the USD,” said Mark McCormick, global head of foreign exchange strategy at TD Securities. Though the U.S. currency had drifted higher against the Australian and New Zealand dollars, those trends mostly reversed by Monday afternoon as the weekend’s OPEC+ deal failed to soothe supply concerns. Major oil producers agreed to the output cuts on Sunday to prop up oil markets as the pandemic severely curtailed global demand. “Oil-exposed currencies were subdued despite OPEC’s record production cuts of nearly 10 million barrels a day. The cartel hopes that the record agreement will help put a floor under oil prices. Still, the outlook remains troubled for oil markets given that the coronavirus has significantly damaged demand,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions.

5e7abb7bb55689732e7e7a18	Bitcoin Price: How Will Halving, Coronavirus Affect BTC?	Bitcoin halving is the process in which so-called “miners” – covered in the section below – are rewarded 50% fewer BTC for verifying transactions in the blockchain network. This is scheduled to occur every 210,000 blocks and is designed to help preserve Bitcoin’s allure as a store of value. The cap for Bitcoin is set at 21 million, thereby keeping the supply finite. There is no Bitcoin central bank that can simply print more BTC. In fact, the guiding purpose of the cryptocurrency and the very thing underpinning its broad appeal is that it operates on a decentralized network that cannot be controlled by a single person or institution. Halving is written into the Bitcoin algorithmic protocol, designed by the enigmatic person or group known only as Satoshi Nakamoto during the 2008 global financial crisis. In short: Bitcoin mining is a series of operations performed by a computer to solve math problems. These are programmed to become progressively more difficult with every verified transaction in the blockchain. As a reward for solving these mathematical puzzles – with a probability of 1 in 13 trillion of getting it right – Bitcoin miners are awarded an amount of BTC. The next halving – the third since Bitcoin's inception – is scheduled to occur on May 18, 2020. Miners will start to receive 6.25 BTC per block transaction, 50 percent less than the prior 12.50 BTC compensation (hence, “halving”). Traders will keep a close eye on how prices respond. Assuming supply stays constant and demand increases, scarcity will drive Bitcoin higher. However, the infamous economics tagline “ceteris paribus” has proven to be an unreliable assumption enough times before, and the macro context in which prior halvings occurred varied. Consequently, Bitcoin’s price change in each of these events was not the result of a rigid formula but a circumstantial reaction to the environment in which the halving occurred. Leading up to and following a Bitcoin halving, markets frequently witnessed high periods of volatility. However, price swings may be tamed by traders who have priced in the anticipated change and positioned themselves ahead of it. Since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009, there have been two halvings occurring at four-year intervals – on November 28, 2012 and July 9, 2016. Bitcoin prices rose approximately 18 percent in the month before the halvings of 2012 and 2016. They added an additional 8 percent after the first instance but fell 16 percent following the second one. Volatility this year may be particularly difficult to gauge because of two opposing forces that could amplify or dampen high-magnitude price swings. The first is the coronavirus outbreak, which has catalyzed a selloff in global equities and exposed the fragilities of an already-weak global economy. Volatility linked to this exogenous shock may distort the price response from Bitcoin halving. During this time, BTC may also reveal what could be an intrinsically speculative nature, thereby undermining its claim to be a stable medium of exchange. The second has to do with the considerably more up-to-date Bitcoin infrastructure now compared with prior halvings, which may mitigate volatility. Even as recently as 2017, exchanges were experiencing a slew of technical issues including losing client funds, subsequently leading to surges in volatility as liquidity dried up. It was not until around 2019 that reputable exchanges and custodians began to appear and helped to fortify the operational integrity of the cryptocurrency market. With these upgrades and a more efficient market structure in place, scope for significant halving-induced volatility may be reduced. That is, violent price swings set off by the split itself may be more subdued than in prior years. When all 21 million Bitcoins have been mined – with an estimated end date at 2140 – BTC supply increases will end, and the price of the digital token will be fully at the mercy of what prevailing demand is at that time. Furthermore, the cost of generating new Bitcoin every year grows while the reward diminishes as every halving reduces the number of digital tokens awarded to its excavators. The algorithm is written in such a way that over time, fewer miners will be able to continue their operations and will be forced to shut down. As the blockchain puzzles become more difficult to solve, input costs like electricity and hardware replacement will rise, while their revenue – i.e. Bitcoins generated – will dwindle. The result will be fewer miners spawning fewer BTC, thereby encouraging scarcity. Unlike a fiat currency – say, the US Dollar – the supply of Bitcoin is limited. While there has been speculation that it may become a global currency, BTC proponents must first reconcile a plethora of dilemmas. One of the biggest of these will be shedding Bitcoin’s reputation as a speculative instrument and rebranding it as a reliable medium of exchange by taming violent volatility. This helps to differentiate widely-used fiat currency like the US Dollar from a digital token like Bitcoin. There is no halving equivalent for currencies. The closest comparison may be hawkish monetary policy, where the raising of interest rates aims to reduce lending and constrict the money supply. That is an incomplete analogy however since a central bank can choose to loosen credit conditions as well as tighten them. Much like Bitcoin, Litecoin – a descendent of the original cryptocurrency – also undergoes a halving period every four years. The last to occur was on August 5, 2019 and saw the number of digital tokens awarded to miners reduced to 12.5 LTC per block. The next split is expected to take place on August 6, 2023 where the compensation for digital excavators will be down to 6.25 Litecoins. The coronavirus may also play a role in driving up the price of Bitcoin. The global pandemic emanating from China has spread throughout the world and disrupted global supply chains, hitting the tech sector particularly hard. Consequently, so-called “mining farms” – which are typically giant warehouses filled with computers running on electricity 24/7 solving blockchain-related math puzzles – may face supply shortages. Governments across the world have initiated lockdown procedures and mandated for their citizens to self-quarantine to mitigate Covid-19 contagion. However, delayed orders and congested ports mean miners may not get access to hardware they require to keep verifying transactions and producing more Bitcoin. BTC scarcity linked to the virus and to halving could thus constrict supply and drive prices higher. --- Written by Dimitri Zabelin, Jr Currency Analyst for DailyFX.com To contact Dimitri, use the comments section below or @ZabelinDimitrion Twitter	BTC
5e5d08052e1fe5553d2b63c3	U.S Nonfarm Payrolls and Chatter on Trade Puts the Dollar in the Spotlight	It was a relatively busy day on the economic calendar through the Asian session this morning. Key stats included October manufacturing PMI numbers out of Australia and China, along with 3rd quarter wholesale inflation figures out of Australia. Japan’s job/application ratio for September was of less influence on the day. Outside of the numbers, negative sentiment towards trade from Thursday spilled into the morning session to limit risk appetite. The Jobs/applications ratio fell from 1.59 to 1.57 in September. Economists had forecast for the ratio to hold steady at 1.59. The Japanese Yen moved from ¥108.021 to ¥107.990 upon release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Japanese Yen was down by 0.01% to ¥108.04 against the U.S Dollar. The AIG Manufacturing Index slid from 54.7 to 51.6 in October. According to the latest AIG report, The Aussie dollar held steady at 0.68919 upon release of the figures that preceded wholesale inflation figures the manufacturing PMI numbers out of China. In the 3rd quarter, the Producer Price Index rose by 0.4%, quarter-on-quarter, which was in line with expectations. In the 2nd quarter, the index had also risen by 0.4%. The annual rate of wholesale inflation eased, however, from 2% to 1.6%. Economists had forecast an annual rate of inflation of 1.8%. According to the ABS, The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.68842 to $0.68884 upon release of the figures that preceded China’s manufacturing PMI numbers. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was up by 0.17% to $0.6906. The Caixin Manufacturing PMI rose from 51.4 to 51.7 in October, coming in ahead of a forecasted 51.0. According to the October PMI Survey, The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.68984 to $0.69094 upon release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Kiwi Dollar was up by 0.36% to $0.6436. It’s a quiet day ahead on the economic calendar. There are no material stats due out of the Eurozone to provide the EUR with direction. The lack of stats will leave the markets to focus on stats out of the U.S later today, the UK general election campaign trail and any chatter on trade. At the time of writing, the EUR was up by 0.09% to $1.1162. It’s a relatively quiet day ahead on the data front. October’s manufacturing PMI is due out later this morning. We can expect Pound sensitivity to today’s figures, with economists forecasting a quicker pace of contraction in October. Outside of the numbers, there is also the general election to consider and any initial polls and implications to Britain’s membership with the EU. At the time of writing, the Pound was up by 0.11% to $1.2956. It’s another busy day ahead on the economic calendar. Key stats October nonfarm payroll and wage growth figures and October’s ISM Manufacturing PMI numbers. While the October unemployment rate will also have an impact on the day, we would expect finalized Markit manufacturing PMI numbers to be brushed aside. Outside of the numbers, geopolitics remains in focus. Any further chatter on trade will also influence. The Dollar Spot Index was down by 0.15% to 97.209 at the time of writing. It’s a quiet day on the economic calendar. There are no material stats due out following disappointing data on Thursday. Private sector PMI numbers out of China this morning and from the U.S later today will influence crude oil prices and the Loonie. The Loonie was up by 0.05% to C$1.3158, against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing.	JPY
5e81b610c496d2354de7304c	Appetite for market risk is very low	Tuesday January 22: Five things the markets are talking about Appetite for risk in this holiday shorted week starts on the low side with Euro and Asia equities under pressure in their respective sessions, along with U.S futures, as an uncertain outlook for global trade and growth continues to inhibit investor appetite. Data on the weekend showed that the world’s second largest economy, China, grew at its slowest pace (+6.6% y/y) in nearly three-decades in 2018, while yesterday, the IMF cut its forecasts for global economic growth this year to +3.5% from October’s +3.7% and from the +3.9% it had expected last July. They indicated that “global expansion has weakened,” dragged down by poor performance in Europe and some emerging markets. However, data stateside is beginning to be pressured by the Sino-U.S trade dispute and the ongoing partial U.S government shutdown. The U.S dollar remains better bid for a sixth consecutive session as the go-to safe haven currency pair, while U.S Treasuries and Euro sovereign yields fall. Despite Brexit uncertainty outcomes, sterling, for the time being, remains contained after U.K PM Theresa May indicated yesterday that she will seek changes to the Irish border backstop to address parliament’s worries. She also added that “Brexit negotiations won’t be delayed and that there won’t be a second Brexit referendum.” On Tap: U.S earning season remains in full swing, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) meet later this evening, which European Central Bank (ECB) monetary committee meet Thursday. Davos day 1 begins this morning. 1. Stocks dip on global growth worries In Japan, the Nikkei edged lower overnight, retreating from a one-month high print Monday as investors took profits from recent gainers amid concerns about slowing economic growth. The index shed -0.47%, after Monday’s record print, while the broader Topix lost -0.6%. Down-under, Aussie shares ended a five-day rally on weak financials and mining stocks. The S&P/ASX 200 index fell -0.5%. The benchmark rallied +0.2% on Monday. In S. Korea, the Kospi stock index closed weaker as data showed weakening exports had hit last year’s annual pace of growth to a six-year low, while global growth worries darkened investor outlook. At the close, the index ended down -0.32%. In China, equities fell overnight as investors braced for a tough start to the New Year amid weak economic outlook domestically and abroad. At the close, the Shanghai Composite index fell -1.2%, while the blue-chip CSI300 index fell -1.3%. In Hong Kong, it was a similar story, at the close of trade, the Hang Seng index was down -0.7% and in line with a broad retreat across the region as profit-takers took control. In Europe, regional bourses trade lower, following a negative session in Asia and negative U.S futures as macro developments remain in focus. U.S stocks are set to open in the ‘red’ (-0.6%). Indices: Stoxx600 -0.12% at 355.92, FTSE -0.46% at 6,938.73, DAX -0.22% at 11,111.49, CAC-40 -0.30% at 4,853.01, IBEX-35 -0.14% at 9,041.00, FTSE MIB -0.51% at 19,538.50, SMI -0.28% at 8,994.20, S&P 500 Futures -0.60% 2. Oil prices ease as China growth worries spread, gold lower Ahead of the U.S open, oil prices are under pressure on signs that an economic slowdown in China, the world’s second-largest economy and oil consumer, is spreading, fuelling worries over future fuel demand. Brent oil futures are at +$62.26 per barrel, down -48c, or -0.8%, from Monday’s close, while U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures are at +$53.43 per barrel, down -0.7%, or -37c. To date, China’s crude import numbers have so far resisted China’s economic slowdown, hitting a record above +10M bpd in Q4, 2018, but many now believe that the world’s second largest economy may be experiencing “peak energy growth,” with its demand set to reduce as the slowdown takes a deeper effect. OPEC+ indicated last week that they had cut oil output sharply in December 2018 before a new accord to limit supply took effect on Jan. 1. This would suggest that the main producers have made a strong start to avoid creating a supply glut in 2019. In its monthly report, OPEC’s oil output fell by -751K bpd in December to +31.58M bpd, the biggest month-on-month drop in 24-months. Note: The combination of production cuts by OPEC+, especially the Saudis, and tightening sanctions on Iranian oil exports is trying to bring the market close to equilibrium. Also, a surge in U.S crude output is undermining most of OPEC’s efforts – U.S output has increased by more than +2M bpd in the last 12-months to +11.9M bpd. With the “big” dollar in demand, the precious yellow metal comes under pressure. Gold prices are hovering atop of their new three-week low touched yesterday, as a strong dollar limits gains. Spot gold is mostly unchanged at +$1,279.68 per ounce, after touching its lowest since Dec. 28 at +$1,276.31 on Monday. U.S. gold futures have fallen -0.3% to +$1,279.40 per ounce. 3. Sovereign yields trade on the soft side on growth worries Eurozone government bond yields trade a tad lower as investors continue to remain cautious over Brexit developments, as well as expecting the ECB to mention growth concerns at Thursday’s meeting – a more “dovish” statement than currently priced in. Data on the weekend showed that China’s economic growth slowed to a 30-year low in 2018, while yesterday, the IMF trimmed its’ 2019 and 2020 world growth forecasts – citing Italy as one of the main risks to growth because of its spending plans. The 10-year German Bund yield trades at +0.183%, down about -2.5 bps. Note: Eurozone futures pricing suggests that the market is pricing roughly a +40% chance that the ECB will raise its deposit rate +10 bps by the end of this year. It is now minus -0.40%. Elsewhere, the yield on U.S 10-year Treasuries sank -4 bps to +2.75%, the largest tumble in more than a week. In the U.K, the 10-year Gilt yield dipped -2 bps points to +1.3%, the lowest in a week, while in Italy, 10-year BTP yield fell less than -1 bps to +2.756%. 4. Risk aversion dominates proceedings Some risk aversion has eased back into the market and is helping to support the ‘big’ dollar atop of its three-week high prints. GBP/USD (£1.2914) was initially trading on the softer side as the market noted that PM May’s plan B looked a lot like the failed plan A and did little to clarify the governments future Brexit plan. The pair continued to find support in the lower part of the £1.2850, however, better employment data (see below) supported sterling’s positive sentiment with the pair trading above the psychological £1.29 level ahead of the U.S open. EUR/USD (€1.1362) is steady and continues to remain confined within a €1.13-1.15 trading range. German Jan ZEW survey (-15 vs. -18.8) this morning was mixed, but suggested that market had already considerably lowered their growth expectations USD/JPY (¥109.43) is a tad lower by -0.3% on some interesting safe-haven flow trading at ¥109.45-55 area. The markets focus now shifts to the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) rate decision later this evening, but no changes are expected. 5. U.K employment keeps rising despite Brexit worries Data this morning showed that the U.K economy continued to add jobs last year, despite the uncertainty facing businesses over the way the country will leave the E.U. The ONS said today that the number of people in work in the three-months through November was up +141K, raising the employment rate to +75.8%, a record high. More people were looking for work, and the number of unemployed rose by +8K vs. the previous three-month period, although the jobless rate stayed at +4.0%, its lowest level for four-decades. With vacancies at a joint record high (+853K) employers raised wages by +3.4% y/y, and since pay rose faster than consumer prices, real wages were +1.2% higher, the largest increase in two-years. Governor Carnet at the Bank of England (BoE) still expects a tightening labor market to push wages higher and keep inflation above its target over coming years, signaling that it intends to lift its key interest rate gradually and to a limited extent.

5e5d08e7bd5d9d5ac07275ec	US Dollar Price Action Pulls Back - Trade or Fade: EUR/USD, USD/CAD	It’s been a busy year so far in the US Dollar: After the currency put in a pronounced bearish reversal in Q4 of last year, the USD came into 2020 trade grasping for support at a key Fibonacci level. After the first few days of the New Year brought in a series of higher-lows, an ascending triangle had built, opening the door for bullish breakout potential in the USD. That further priced-through for the next few weeks, with the US Dollar catching a downdraft around the January FOMC rate decision. At that meeting, the Fed didn’t really tip their hand towards any future rate moves, instead trying to remain flexible while communicating a tone of stability. But that only lasted into the end of that week as the Greenback was ready to go into launch mode after the February open, and that theme ran very loudly for the first few weeks of the month as the US Dollar jumped up to a fresh three-year-high, erasing the entirety of the Q4 sell-off and making a fast approach towards the 100.00 level in DXY. Friday brought a pullback and yesterday a show of support. That support has held through the Thursday opens in Asia and Europe, and ahead of the US equity open, support continues to contain the lows. USD on Tradingview Probably one of the loudest markets for that recent rush of US Dollar strength has been the Euro, where EUR/USD pushed down to a fresh two-year-low. The pair began to fill a gap that’s been lurking on the charts since April of 2017, around the weekend of French elections. At that event, EUR/USD closed one week at 1.0725 and then quickly gapped-higher as the next week opened; with only a portion of that gap getting filled, down to the approximate 1.0820. This left approximately 95 pips of unfilled gap on the chart that, at this point, remains an item of interest on the short-side of the pair. At this point, the current two-year-low in EUR/USD sits at 1.0777: sellers had multiple opportunities to push-lower last week but have since failed; and price action has built in a series of higher-lows along with a horizontal level of resistance. This presents a short-term ascending triangle which, similar to the US Dollar at the beginning of the year, could open the door to a deeper reversal. Sitting ahead on EUR/USD charts are potential resistance areas around 1.0890 and 1.0925. After that, a big zone of prior support that hasn’t yet been tested for resistance comes into play around the psychological 1.1000 level. EUR/USD on Tradingview As looked at last week in the Thursday webinar, one of the areas that could be accommodative for continued USD-strength was/is USD/CAD. The pair put in an especially strong first six weeks of the New Year as a bit of CAD-weakness joined with USD-strength to amount for a strong topside breakout. But price action stretched into a sticky zone of resistance in mid-February and spent much of the week-and-a-half after in a pullback. But, as looked at last week in the USD/CAD technical analysis article, the pair had pulled back in an orderly fashion, building a falling wedge with support showing around a key Fibonacci level. After gapping-higher to start this week, USD/CAD has once again found resistance around the 1.3308 level. For those looking at long-USD strategies, USD/CAD remains a market of interest.

5e81b5cbc496d2354de72fec	May’s Resignation means Brexit is Back to Square One	One word perfectly sums up the events of this week. Disappointing. For some it began with the uninspiring conclusion of Game of Thrones, long-term stock investors grimaced at the lack of progress with the US-China trade war, and FX traders will see the British pound remain in limbo after Prime Minister May admitted defeat in failing to deliver a Brexit deal. Theresa May’s watch will end on June 7th and the Brexit process basically goes back to square one. The short-term fate of the British pound will depend on the final candidates preference for type of Brexit (soft/hard) and if they appear capable of negotiating across party lines to secure the votes in getting a deal pushed through Parliament. European politics remain front and center as Nationalist and far-right parties are expected to make progress in gaining European Parliamentary seats. The result from the elections will likely deliver further friction within the bloc and more hurdles on integration. The trade war has delivered a major blow to risk appetite with all three major US indexes posting weekly losses, as well big monthly declines. Both the Chinese and Americans appear poised to ramp up domestic support/stimulus in the event of a prolonged standoff. Someone will blink and lead the return to the negotiating table, both sides are motivated, but we may need to see more market carnage before that happens. Key upcoming events include a rate decision from the Bank of Canada, the annual budget release for New Zealand, US preliminary Q1 GDP reading, China’s Manufacturing PMI reading and Canadian GDP. PM Boris Johnson unlikely Theresa May’s announcement means Brexit is right back to where we were right after the Referendum. The Brexit outcomes are still plentiful: We could see the Brexit deadline extended beyond Halloween, a general election is very possible or a second referendum asking for a no-deal or to remain. Uncertainty will remain in place until we learn more about who will take over the negotiations and that process will take almost two months. The current favorite to replace Theresa May is former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a hardliner that would suggest a greater risk for a no-deal Brexit. History however is not on Mr. Johnson’s side, as he was the odds on favorite last time. The British pound is likely to remain volatile and the risks could be to the upside following the recent precipitous drop. The markets will likely expect an orderly exit, and that should prove supportive for cable. Dollar bottom in place The latest reports on housing and durable goods is not pointing an optimistic outlook for the US economy. US economic data points still outperform the other advanced economies, but its strength is heavily priced in FX markets, which could mean we may have just seen a key bottom put in place for the dollar. While the financial markets have been hit with a wave of risk aversion that has sent bond market yields plummeting. Despite the recent optimism from the Fed and their minutes, risks to the downside are growing and the Fed may need to deliver another dovish message in the coming months that cement rate cut bets in the nearer future. Current expectations are at 55% for a rate cut at the September meeting, but that could increase as growth has been dealt a strong blow from the US-China trade war and cautious tones from this past earnings season. Oil Crude prices have been battered by global demand concerns, rising stockpiles in the US and fading expectations that OPEC and their allies will unanimously be on board and deliver an extension of production cuts this year. The markets have been closely paying attention to the trade war between two largest economies and the lack of progress is likely to put an unexpected dent in demand forecasts for the second quarter. The wildcard for oil remains geopolitical risks as tensions remain high between the US and Iran. The US appears set on showing Iran they are prepared for an escalation in the region. President Trump is sending 1,500 troops to assure freedom of navigation in the area. While both sides appear not interested in starting a war, tensions are flaring up and the risks for some conflict are growing. Spare capacity and output at risk should support for a stabilization in prices in the short-term, but if we see another multi-million barrel build with US inventories, oil could see the bearish correction continue. Gold Gold prices remain in a quagmire as wave of risk aversion that has sent bond market yields plummeting has yielded minuscule gains for the safe-haven. The last six weeks of yellow metal trading has seen alternative bullish/bearish trading that for the most part has been kept in a tight $1,270 to $1,300 range. The deflationary conditions globally have hurt the inflationary pressure reason for owning gold. With US equities hovering within 5% of their record highs, gold is likely to have difficulty breaking out. Gold may need the Fed to confirm what markets are pricing in already and signal rate cuts are coming. That however may not happen anytime soon, if we see a resumption of constructive trade talks between the US and China. Bitcoin Some past Bitcoin skeptics, such as JP Morgan and Facebook are becoming believers in cryptocurrencies. The recent surge with Bitcoin was supported on the continued progress with mainstream commerce adoption. First, we saw JP Morgan create the first US bank-backed cryptocurrency, then we saw Fidelity launch plans for institutional bitcoin trading, and E-Trade intends to offer cryptocurrency trading on their platforms. The financial community is seeing more companies want to take advantage of the digital currency and the latest to join is Facebook. The social media giant aims at competing with banks in offering secure and cheaper ways of sending money. Bitcoin is meteoric rise immediately was followed by a tulip-mania crash. The current rally is seeing price trade around the $8,000 level and further mainstream acceptance could prove vital for the bullish momentum to continue. To the upside the psychological $10,000 level provides key resistance, while $6,500 remains major support.

5e81b5cbc496d2354de72ff4	Danger ahead as markets look for clues on trade	Week of May 13-17 Despite risk appetite improving, market waits for further trade clues The Sino-U.S trade war is heating up, continued worries about conflict in the Middle East and concerns over global growth have sent investors rushing to own over-weighted risk aversion trading strategies – ¥, CHF, gold, and bonds have been added to many portfolios. Global sovereign bond yields are trading atop of three-year low yields, and this despite China’s holdings of U.S treasuries having started to fall for the first time in eight-months. As comments between the Trump and China continue to dominate the main stage, China is seen becoming more aggressive saying that if the U.S continues on their path, they will have to take necessary countermeasures. They also urge the U.S to cancel the tariffs on Chinese goods to avoid causing a recession like impact on the world economy. Nevertheless, President Trump keeps on prodding, he signed an executive order that would let the U.S ban telecommunications gear from “foreign adversaries,” underscoring tensions with China even as the U.S said it would likely resume trade talks soon in Beijing after reaching an impasse last week. Despite the ongoings with China, the White House has delayed for six month a decision about whether to impose levies on foreign cars and car parts – especially aimed at Japan and Europe – Trump is trying to minimize the number of trade war front that the U.S are engaged in. Even Mnuchin and co. are closing in on an agreement with Mexico and Canada to roll back tariffs on steel and aluminum, which were imposed last year – a plus for CAD and MXN. Central Banks positioning This week, Poland’s Central Bank (NBP) left their base rate unchanged at +1.50%, as expected. It was their 46th consecutive pause in their easing cycle. While the Hungarian Central Bank (MNB) April minutes indicated that all nine-rate setters backed holding rates steady for the foreseeable future. Elsewhere, the Philippines central bank also followed up last week’s rate cut with a RRR cut of -2%. The additional cut is aimed at easing a liquidity crunch that is accelerating in Manila. Bitcoin no flash in the pan Japanese, Chinese and other Asian investors are piling up on bitcoin as the cryptocurrency price surges to its highest in 10-months. Proprietary trading firms and Asian brokers are behind the increase in trading activity. LMAX Digital, an exchange platform has seen volumes quadruple over the past four-weeks to +$2.2B. Currencies in the spotlight AUD and Aussie bond yields have taken a hit this week as June interest rate cut bets rise after disappointing April unemployment data. The unexpected jump in Australia’s unemployment rate to +5.2% in April can be partly explained by an increase in the participation rate to +65.8% from 65.7% in March. Other parts of the employment report were mixed. The headline change in jobs looked good, an addition of a net +28.4K, but the details showed a loss of -6.3K full-time positions and an increase of +34.7K part-time ones. Brexit woes ongoing In the U.K. PM May is due to meet senior Conservative MP’s who are demanding she sets a date for her departure from Downing Street. The PM, who is under growing pressure from her own MP’s to stand aside, will meet the executive of the backbench 1922 Committee to discuss her future – if there is another vote on rule changes could allow May’s leadership to be challenged before December. Sterling is trading atop of its three-month lows and the GBP ‘bears’ see further losses as concerns grow about the U.K political instability and the shakiness of May’s position. People’s Bank of China (PBoC) remains wary of Yuan weakness The 2% fall in the renminbi since the US-China trade war flared up again reflects market pressure more than a deliberate policy choice – Chinese policymakers have actually been trying to slow its slide. If trade talks break down entirely, they would have less incentive to keep doing so. Consensus to date believe it’s unlikely that they would go further and actively try to weaken the renminbi to hit back at the U.S. Italy is heading for another clash with the EU Recent comments by Italy’s deputy prime minister have increased the risk that Italy is placed in an E.U disciplinary procedure later this year. A number of developments have increased the risk of a re-run of last year’s spat between Italy and the EU. The European Commission’s (EC’s) updated forecasts, published last week, showed Italy’s budget deficit rising to 3.5% of GDP next year, breaching the EU’s 3% deficit limit. Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said this week that he would have “no problem breaking the deficit limit or seeing the public debt ratio rise above 140% of GDP.” Note: June 5, the EC will publish an assessment of Italy’s public finances, which is likely to conclude that Italy needs to reduce its deficit. Economic events On the Economic Calendar, tomorrow Australian Parliamentary elections take place (May 17). A panel of energy ministers from major oil producers, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, known as the JMMC, meets on May 19 to discuss the oil market and make recommendations before the 176th OPEC Meeting on June 25.

5e5d0914bd5d9d5ac0727637	USD/CAD Outlook Bearish, EUR/USD Forecast Bullish on Positioning	The Canadian Dollar and Euro face inflation data this week that may alter near-term dovish expectations for the Bank of Canada and European Central Bank respectively. In this week’s session, I discussed how trader psychology is shaping the trends in USD/CAD and EUR/USD and what could be in store ahead. IG Client Sentiment (IGCS) is painting a bearish picture for the former and a bullish one for the latter. At the time of this writing, about 24.31% of traders are net-long USD/CAD according to IGCS. Those biased to the upside have been increasing while investors unwinding short bets have been on the rise. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current USD/CAD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short. That would speak to more and more investors attempting to start picking the pair’s bottom. From a technical standpoint, USD/CAD continues its descent following the emergence of bearish signals. These include an Evening Star candlestick pattern and the close under near-term rising support. That is leaving prices facing immediate support at 1.3208. If the latter is taken out, it would expose the psychological barrier between 1.3111 to 1.3134. USD/CAD Chart Created in Trading View IGCS shows that about 74.27% of EUR/USD traders are net long, up from about a 36% upside bias in early January. Since then, prices declined about 4% as an increasing amount of investors attempted to pick the bottom in the Euro. Yet, recent changes in sentiment warn that the current price trend may soon reverse higher despite the fact traders remain net long. Bears may view this as a signal to stand aside in the interim. EUR/USD has taken out lows from May 2017 as the Euro sank to its weakest point this year so far. That has exposed the 100% point of the Fibonacci extension at 1.0706. My majors-based Euro index recently flashed a bearish technical warning, hinting that EUR may on average have more room to extend its recent declines. Maintaining the downtrend in the medium-term may be potential falling resistance from December.

5e5d0866bd5d9d5ac07275b8	Gold Prices Suffer Worst Daily Decline Since 2013, Virus Fears Forefront	Risk aversion in markets hit a fever pitch in recent days as coronavirus fears inject worry over the global economies’ ability to weather its impact. Despite the severe move seen across markets today, prompted by increasing concerns over the coronavirus, gold sold off along with equities to defy its more common negative correlation with the growth-sensitive asset class. In recent months, gold has strengthened considerably and approached overbought conditions prompting traders to look for near-term consolidation. Spot gold started the week higher, gapping up in Sunday night trading to $1660.11, but began trading lower through the week. Friday saw the biggest intraday selloff in the yellow metal since 2013, as it dropped over 3.5 percent intraday. Currently sitting at $1584.40, support from consolidation formed throughout January and February could buoy price from a further move down in the short term. Furthermore, continued deterioration in market sentiment could prompt gold to fall further as investors rotate capital into highly liquid assets such as cash and US treasuries. --Written by Thomas Westwater, Intern Analyst for DailyFX.com Contact and follow Thomas on Twitter @FxWestwater	METAL
5e65b509b6257a636fed6633	US Dollar Fundamental Outlook: USD/SGD, USD/IDR, USD/MYR, USD/PHP	The haven-linked US Dollar broadly speaking underperformed this past week against its major counterparts. That weakness also extended to its ASEAN peers such as the Singapore Dollar, Indonesian Rupiah, Malaysian Ringgit and Philippine Peso. In other parts of Asia, the Greenback soared against the Indian Rupee as local banking woes further threatened the economic outlook. USD/MYR looked past a Bank of Malaysia rate cut. The US Dollar has generally been focusing on its deteriorating return, particularly after the Federal Reserve delivered an emergency 50-bp rate cut last week. This has resulted in aggressive declines in local government bond yields. In fact, the 10-year rate on local Treasuries dropped under 1.00% for the first time on record. What this can translate into for developing nations – including ASEAN – are favorable repaying conditions. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, borrowing costs in the United States sharply dropped and fell to zero. After, emerging market economies generally increased borrowing to support local growth and finances. The drop in U.S. rates thus makes it relatively easier to repay foreign debt and more may be coming. Fed funds futures indicate that 2 rate cuts later this month are fully priced in with odds of a third greater than 50%. What this has led to are tumbling bond yield spreads between United States and ASEAN nations. On the chart below, I have outlined the difference in US, Singaporean, Indonesian and Malaysian 10-year government bond yields. My ASEAN-based US Dollar index – which averages it versus SGD, IDR, MYR and PHP – has been closely following the deterioration in bond yield spreads and may continue so in the short term. Chart Created in TradingView The week ahead has a relatively lighter economic docket, both from ASEAN nations and the United States. Highlights include January’s Philippine trade balance, Malaysian and Indian industrial production. Across the Pacific Ocean, U.S. CPI data is on tap for February. Markets may pay closer attention to the University of Michigan Sentiment data on Friday which is expected to drop to its lowest since September 2019. The delay in the impact of the coronavirus on U.S. data was made apparent last week. Markets largely brushed off a blowout in February’s non-farm payrolls report which has yet to capture the shock of the spreading virus. With monetary policy having only so much room to react in an era of low interest rates, the focus for supporting growth arguably turns to fiscal stimulus. The $7.8b package passed last week by Congress and the White House has yet to translate into a “risk-on” tone in markets. According to White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow, tariff policy changes amid the Wuhan virus outbreak are “not on the table now”. As a reminder, before the coronavirus, global growth had already been slowing on the trade war. A temporary lifting of tariffs could help boost market confidence. That may translate into some strength in the US Dollar if further fiscal support dampens the needs for what little room there is left to loosen monetary policy. Otherwise, local bond yields may continue their plunge, offering some downward pressures in USD/SGD, USD/IDR, USD/MYR and USD/PHP. The upside potential still remains that the US Dollar, as the world’s reserve currency, sees a sudden surge in haven demand.

5e8d965ba586016213e19970	Marathon, not a sprint	Insurers, supermarkets and miners are being sold off on the FTSE this morning as it becomes clear that despite the recent plateauing of new cases in Europe’s worst hit countries, it will still be weeks before businesses and industries in Europe return to any semblance of normal. However, encouragingly the FTSE league table is beginning to look more like a normal day’s trading with a healthy number of stocks on both sides of the index. Tesco provided the first more comprehensive glimpse into how supermarkets fared during the corona crisis, showing that after the first few weeks of panic buying shop sales have fallen back to pre-crisis levels. Some items like soap, tinned tomatoes and baked beans have seen more than a 100% increase in sales but the chain had to also face much higher expenses, paying for additional staff not only to meet rising demand but also to cover absences. Tellingly, the company refrained from making forecasts for the rest of the year given the current unpredictable situation. German travel group TUI, one of the hardest hit stocks during this crisis, bounced 6.8% after it signed a nearly $2 billion state-aid bridging loan with development bank KfW. TUI had to suspend its tour operator, flight, hotel and cruises last month and hopes that the loan will help it stay afloat. Oil nudges higher ahead of OPEC meeting Crude oil investors are positioning themselves for OPEC and Russia to provide them with good news tomorrow – a broad production cut that will take the currently superflous oil out of the market. Nothing is clear cut; Saudi Arabia and Russia have already delayed the meeting from Monday to Thursday because of disagreements while both wait for signs that the US will also join in the production reductions before committing to cuts themselves.

5e5e291418538f1034fdffa3	Sterling rebounds as recovery in risk appetite hits dollar	LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling rebounded on Tuesday as markets worrying about the spread of coronavirus found some stability, encouraging investors to pare back their rush into dollars that had sent the British currency lower. Traders of the pound will also be watching for developments in Brussels and London ahead of the European Union and Britain beginning their negotiations to agree a trade deal for the end of a Brexit transition period in December 2020. On Tuesday, however, the main driver of the pound was a tentative recovery in risk appetite following Monday’s significant selloff. European and U.S. stocks had suffered their biggest loses since mid-2016 amid fears the coronavirus was morphing into a pandemic that could cripple global supply chains and wreak far greater economic damage than first thought. That sent investors clambering for the safety of the dollar, the world’s most liquid currency. Most other currencies were hit, and sterling fell to as low as $1.2887. By 0910 GMT on Tuesday, the pound had rallied back towards $1.30, and was last up 0.4% at $1.2978. Against the euro sterling also rose, up 0.3% at 83.69 pence. The pound has been supported this month thanks to signs of a rebound in the UK economy and on expectations a new finance minister will raise public spending at next month’s budget. With little in the way of new economic data, investors are also focussed on EU and UK relations ahead of both sides launching into trade negotiations. RBC Capital Markets Global Head of FX Strategy Elsa Lignos said media reports pointing out EU and British differences over their negotiation mandates showed that “the two sides are far apart as a starting point and it remains to be seen how much progress they can make in the remaining nine months”.

5e81b56cc496d2354de72fb0	Market Rally Still Going Low Holiday Volumes Awaiting Start of 2020	The US dollar is on the backfoot at the end of the year as the trade truce between the US and China has opened the risk appetite flood gates. Risk aversion had limited gains in global stock markets and currencies. The optimism around a phase 1 deal is still high, but more details should be coming in the new year to see how “limited” the agreement really is. Gold is back above $1,500 to close out the year as dollar weakness and demand for bullion pushed the yellow metal higher. Higher risk appetite and signs of a trade truce put pressure on gold, but with Brexit and the US presidential elections awaiting in 2020 there will be demand for a safe haven. The Loonie Got its Groove Back The Canadian dollar had a standout year in 2019 and will be the biggest winner against the dollar. The rate differential has favoured the loonie as the Bank of Canada stood on hold as the Fed cut three times this year. Crude prices improved after Beijing and Washington made peace and the OPEP+ added even more stability by extending and further limiting production. Oil prices are higher after trade between the two largest economies is now on the mend. The actions of the OPEP+ to drop production even further has boosted prices, even as countries who are not part of the agreement will look to reap the benefits. With markets in Christmas slumber-mode, there aren’t too many risk points for Asia next week. Hong Kong The run-up to the Christmas season has been quiet on the protest front, and is likely to continue like that until January. As the economy plunges deeper and deeper into recession, there is a risk that clashes could spring up among the rising unemployed (the unemployment rate rose to a 2-1/2 year high this month) and anti-government protestors. The US-China trade truce might offer a chance for the economy to rebound a touch. November’s retail sales data due on Friday January 3 are not expected to overwhelm. Risk As always, there is the risk that protests turn violent again, which would be negative for the HK33 index and could push USD/HKD back to the upper half of the trading band. China Nothing much to report now that the Phase 1 trade deal is agreed in principle, barring any unforeseen setbacks. Expectations are that it will be ratified/signed in the second half on January. There are no more data points until the December PMIs are released on New Years Eve. Risk Any back-tracking on the Phase 1 details would be negative for risk, hurt the CN50 index and boost USD/CNH. India Nothing to report until next year. Risk n/a Australia It’s almost certain that the RBA is on hold until at least the second half of 2020, barring any sudden downturn in economic data. Wildfires raging in New South Wales could hit economic activity for this quarter. Manufacturing PMI data are due on January 2. Risk Any severe downward bias to AU data would be detrimental to local equities and the AUD, positive for bonds. New Zealand Very quiet for the next week. Japan Japan markets are closed January 1-3, so there isn’t likely to be much activity.

5e5d092f73d82f5acc8afd2a	Australian Retail Sales a Strong Beat	Australian Retail Sales were released earlier today for the month of November at 0.9% vs 0.2% expected and 0.1% last. Although the data was for November, it does not underscore the strength of the data point. This number is the strongest monthly Retail Sales print in over 2 years for Australia! We will need to see if this data can carry forward over the next few months, especially with the US-China “Phase One” trade deal agreement, which could be signed as early as next week. AUD/USD had been trading in a downward sloping trend since mid-2018 from a high of roughly .7675 down to a low of .6675. In mid-December, the pair broke higher out of the channel to the 200 Day Moving Average near .6900 and pulled back to retest the upper trendline of the descending channel. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com On a 240-minute timeframe, the pair traded up to the 161.8% “Golden” Fibonacci retracement level near .7035 from the highs October 31st, 2019 to the low on November 29th, 2019. When the new year opened, the pair pulled back as Middle East tensions grew and wildfires spread throughout Australia. Fears mounted that economic data may take a hit. .6930 seems to have acted as a “line in the sand” for AUD/USD, and once this was broken, the pair moved lower to .6850. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com On a 60-minute timeframe, AUD/USD tried to take out the .6850 level numerous times over the last few days, only to bounce off that level each time. As the pair moved higher today, the 60-minute RSI moved into overbought territory. Price closed the day near .6910, only 10 pips away from the 38.2% Fibonacci level from the highs on December 31st (the “Golden” Fib level on the 240-minute timeframe) to the lows of the past few days near .6850. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Just above these levels is once again .6930. If AUD/USD is to break higher, or gap higher over the weekend, the pair can quickly move up to .7000. However, if .6930 holds, the pair has room to move lower back towards .6850. Keep a close eye on comments from the US or China regarding the signing of the trade deal next week, which may affect the price of AUD/USD.	AUD
5e7c890101dca42ce53fc644	Why is GBP/USD Impacted by Equities?- CAD & Oil Link Breaks Down: Cross-Asset Correlation	In the previous cross-asset correlation report, we had noted that the Pound has become increasingly more sensitive to risk appetite, compared to previously in which the currency had sat in the middle of the risk on-risk off spectrum. This has been further highlighted in the 1-week correlation matrix, showing that GBP/USD has the most positive correlation with global equities (even more so than the Australian Dollar). As we have alluded to previously, the fact that the Pound has a large twin deficit, with the current account deficit among the largest in the G10 complex, means that the UK needs constant inflow of foreign capital. That said, the Pound is likely to take its cue from the macro backdrop as opposed to idiosyncratic factors for now. In recent sessions, the Canadian Dollar has seen its positive correlation with oil breakdown. We feel the reason behind has been due to the fact that the price action in the US Dollar has been the dominant force over the past few weeks. That in mind, while oil prices are having a limited impact on the Canadian Dollar at present, the fact that oil prices are finding a range we feel provides a degree of stabilization in the Loonie. Earlier in the week, the Federal Reserve announced a gamechanger in the form of unlimited QE, while addressing dollar shortage concerns through USD swap lines, which has allowed for a corrective move lower in the greenback. As such, the Canadian Dollar has been on the front foot, however, we still see risks to the downside for equity markets as country lockdowns are extended. Therefore, with safe-haven flows benefitting the greenback we still see upside risks for USD/CAD above 1.40, while CAD/JPY may also offer value on the downside after the Japanese fiscal year end come April.

5e5d08052e1fe5553d2b63ce	The GBP and the Loonie are in Action with Stats and Geopolitics in Focus	It was a quiet day on the economic calendar through the Asian session this morning. There were no material stats released through the session to provide the majors with direction. A lack of stats left the markets to track the European and U.S majors from Monday and respond to events in the UK Parliament and chatter on trade. At the time of writing, the Japanese Yen was down by 0.03% to ¥108.65 against the U.S Dollar, while the Aussie Dollar was up by 0.04% to $0.6871. The Kiwi Dollar was up by 0.36% to $0.6431 Both the Aussie Dollar and Kiwi Dollar have found strong support, driven by monetary policy divergence. The RBA is expected to hold on rates, while the FED is expected to cut rates. The Kiwi Dollar could come undone, however, once the markets begin to look beyond monetary policy decisions through the current month. It’s a quiet day ahead on the economic calendar. There are no material stats due out of the Eurozone to provide the EUR with direction. The lack of stats leaves the EUR exposed to Brexit chatter throughout the day. We’ve seen the EUR and the Pound find strong support on expectations that a no-deal Brexit has been averted. Uncertainty remains, however, with a UK general election the greatest threat to the EUR and the GBP near-term. At the time of writing, the EUR was up by 0.01% to $1.1151. It’s a relatively quiet day ahead on the data front. The UK’s CBI Industrial Trend Orders for October are due out later this afternoon. With stats on the lighter side, the Pound will respond to the CBI number, though direction through the day will continue to be hinged on Brexit. At the time of writing, the Pound was up by 0.18% to $1.2983. It’s a busier day ahead on the economic calendar, with September existing home sales figures due out later today. The Greenback will respond to the numbers, as the housing sector continues to be considered a barometer for the U.S economy. Outside of the numbers, geopolitical risk will continue to influence on the day. The Dollar Spot Index was down 0.03% to 97.297 at the time of writing. It’s a busy day on the economic calendar, with August retail sales figures due out later this afternoon. While the Loonie will continue to be responsive to the election result, retail sales figures will have a material impact today. Outside of the numbers, the BoC will also release its Business Outlook Survey, which will also influence later today. How the BoC sees business sentiment will have a bearing on the monetary policy outlook near-term. Strong retail sales would limit any dovish sentiment, however. The Loonie was up by 0.04% at C$1.3084, against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing.	GBP
5e8a86a9c65aaa4ecbfa3ddb	Pound down after coronavirus-stricken Johnson taken to hospital for tests	TOKYO (Reuters) - The pound fell against the dollar and euro on Monday after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital for tests after showing persistent symptoms of the coronavirus. The yen eased against the dollar after Japanese domestic media reported Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may declare a state of emergency as early as Tuesday to curb an alarming acceleration in coronavirus infections. The dollar was on the back foot against the euro after data last week showed companies in the United States shed jobs at break-neck speed as the COVID-19 pandemic leads the global economy to a deep recession. “When a head of state or government is stricken like this, it will cause concern for holders of sterling and sterling assets,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. “Coronavirus cases in Japan may not peak for another month, so the markets will think that now it’s Japan’s turn. A state of emergency is necessary, but this could be yen negative.” The pound GBP=D3 fell 0.44% to $1.2215 on Monday in Asia. Against the euro, sterling EURGBP=D3 fell 0.35% to 88.49 pence. Johnson was admitted in what Downing Street said was a “precautionary step” because he was showing persistent symptoms of COVID-19 10 days after testing positive for the novel coronavirus. The coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, has turned into a global pandemic that has claimed more than 64,000 lives and paralysed large swathes of the global economy. The yen JPY=EBS fell 0.22% to 108.63 against the dollar. Japan's currency also weakened against the euro EURJPY=EBS and the Australian dollar AUDJPY=. Japan’s prime minister will declare a state of emergency over the coronavirus as early as Tuesday, the Yomiuri newspaper reported, as the number of infections topped 1,000 in the capital, Tokyo. Abe will likely announce his plans to declare the emergency on Monday, the paper said. Pressure has been mounting on the government to make the move as the pace of infections - while slow compared with harder-hit countries around the world - continues to accelerate. The dollar was little changed at $1.0800 per euro EUR=EBS and held steady at 0.9769 Swiss franc CHF=EBS. U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday expressed hope that the United States was seeing a “leveling-off” of the coronavirus crisis in some of the nation’s hot spots. However, sentiment for the greenback remains fragile after a series of data last week showed U.S. job losses are soaring as draconian measures to curb the virus hurt consumer spending and factory activity. Currencies of major oil producers fell in Asia on Monday as oil prices gave up some of their recent gains after Saudi Arabia and Russia postponed to Thursday a meeting about a potential pact to cut production. The rouble RUB=D3 lost more than 0.8% against the dollar, while the Mexican peso fell 1.18%. The Canadian dollar CAD= fell 0.25% against its U.S. counterpart.

5e5d08e773d82f5acc8afca0	Lyft Q4 Results Preview	Losses $1.38 cents per share Revenue: +47% $984 billion vs 63% increase in Q3 Lyft vs Uber Comparisons will of course be drawn between Uber and Lyft. Last week Uber said that it expected to report adjusted profit in Q4 2020, ahead of its previous projection following a narrower than expected loss in Q4. The share price soared 10%. So the pressure is on Lyft to follow Uber’s path to quicker profitability. Failure to do so could hit Lyft’s share price. Regulation Lyft, like Uber, must address regulatory issues. California recently enacted a new law which is currently being challenged, which raises questions over the standards at which a worker is considered an employee and is entitled to sick pay and benefits. If this results in a change to the Lyft business model consumers could face 100% of the bill increase. Traders will be keen to hear Lyft elaborate on the potential impact to the business. A cautious tone could send the share price lower.	EQUITY
5e81b5cbc496d2354de72fed	Bye Bye May – UK PM will step down on June 7	Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday she would step down on June 7, succumbing to calls in her governing Conservative Party to make way for a new leader to try to break an impasse over Britain’s departure from the European Union. “It is now clear to me that it is in the best interests of the country for a new prime minister to lead that effort. So I am today announcing that I will resign as leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party on Friday the 7th of June,” May said. Sterling’s record losing streak combined with the growing risks that Brexit will see a hard exit, is making fund managers abandon long-term ‘bullish’ bets. Just a few months ago, the base case was that Brexit would be delivered by PM May and that it would be a soft exit. However, if we do see Boris Johnson, the current oddsmaker favorite, become Theresa May’s successor, we could see the ‘hardest’ Brexit occur. The pound (£1.2645), which is currently atop of its four-month lows, could see further pressure to target the psychological £1.2000 level and eventually the 2016 lows. A no-deal Brexit and a general election risks are likely to keep the pound under pressure. But a weaker than expected showing for the Brexit party in the EU elections could potentially provide some relief for sterling, particularly if the Liberal Democrats perform strongly. A new Tory leader that is less of a Brexiteer than the likes of Boris Johnson could also see a modest bounce in the pair. Support for Nigel Farage’s “no-deal” supporting party is at +37%, according to a recent survey, compared to +19% for the pro-remain Liberal Democrats and just +7% for PM May’s Conservatives. What’s next? PM Theresa May said she had agreed with Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, that the process for selecting a new leader should begin the week after 7 June.

5e95829f1294313d7782ba3d	GBP/USD bulls return to the game; approach a tougher barrier [Video]	GBPUSD terminated its range bound trading on Monday after the wall around the 1.2460 level, which is also the 50% Fibonacci of the downleg from 1.3513 to 1.1409, collapsed, giving the lead to the bulls. Subsequently, the price strengthened towards the 50-day moving average (SMA) which is currently under examination, with the momentum indicators suggesting that the battle at this point may be an easy one. The RSI is holding a positive slope above its 50-neutral mark, the red Tenkan-sen line is deviating above the blue Kijun-sen, and the MACD is rising within the positive area for the first time since the start of the year. Still, to convince traders over a more sustainable rally, the pair needs to breach the block between the 200-day SMA and the 1.2740 former support level as well. The 61.8% Fibonacci is also in the neighborhood adding extra importance to the area. A closing price above that zone could trigger another bullish session, driving the price probably up to 1.2970. Higher, the medium-term picture would shift back to neutral and the door would open for the 1.3100 and 1.3200 resistance levels. Yet, the bearish cross created between the 50- and the 200-day SMAs is casting doubts on whether the medium-term picture could improve. On the downside, a drop below 1.2460 could be enough to bring the supportive red Tenkan-sen at 1.2368 and the 1.2300 barrier back into focus. Running lower, sellers will push harder to clear the base around the 38.2% Fibonacci of 1.2213 and stretch to 1.2130, where any violation could stage a sharper decline towards the 1.1973 number and the 23.6% Fibonacci of 1.1900, eliminating hopes of an upward-trending market. In brief, GBPUSD is likely to gain new bullish steam in the short-term, though some congestion within the 1.2640-1.2700 zone is possible. In the medium-term, traders would upgrade their bearish outlook to neutral if the price manages to climb above 1.2960.	GBP

5e7a762fcfacc7218af4359b	The Collapse of the Mexican Peso	In what feels like years ago, on February 27th, we wrote about the fall of the Mexican Peso. Fundamentally, we discussed how USD/MXN was heading higher as the carry trade was being unwound. As stocks moved lower, traders had to sell pesos and buy back US Dollar and Euros. As a result, both USD/MXN and EUR/MXN both were moving higher. Technically, price of USD/MXN had broken out of 2 channels, back inside a long-term triangle, and had stalled near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the August 29th, 2019 highs to the February 17th lows. The RSI was overbought, but we discussed how it could become “more overbought”. This is how the chart looked on February 27th: Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com As the selloff continued in global stock markets throughout the month of March, Emerging Market currencies, in general, continued to move lower vs the USD. In particular, the USD/MXN shot higher as demand for US Dollars increased significantly. Although the US Fed flooded the markets with US Dollars and created additional swap lines to provide US dollar liquidity to Mexico, the fear of uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus and the US economy caused traders to flee Mexican pesos. In addition, the Central Bank of Mexico held an emergency meeting of its own on March 20th and cut the benchmark by 50bps to 6.5%. This past weekend, President Trump also closed the US-Mexico border. Below is an updated chart of the USD/MXN. As stocks moved lower, the emerging market pair continued to move higher. On March 3rd , price put in a low of 19.1509 and it was off to the races. Since then, USD/MXN has rallied almost 33% to an all-time high today of 25.4474, however has since pulled back slightly to 24.9228 as stock markets rallied today. Notice how RSI did pull back for a short amount of time into the neutral area but reached a high yesterday of 95.97. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Initial horizontal support comes in 24.9557. If today’s high is to be the high for a while, we can begin to look for Fibonacci levels below for more support. The 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level comes in near 23.0410, which is also close to horizontal support. Below that is the 50% retracement level at 22.2919. Initial resistance is at today’s highs near 25.4447. Today’s high also happens to be the 161.8% extension from the highs on March 19th to the lows on February 20th. Above that is the target for a small flag pattern that has formed over the last few days near 26.65. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com	MXN
5e5d0926bd5d9d5ac0727655	USD Aims Higher vs NOK and SEK on Fed Minutes, Iran Election	The US Dollar may appreciate against the Swedish Krona and Norwegian Krone if the FOMC minutes reveal that officials are comparatively more hawkish than what markets had expected. After Chairman Jerome Powell’s congressional testimonies last week, markets gained some insight as to how the head of the central bank feels about the economy. This came on the back of other FOMC members speaking throughout the week. Having said that, this does not suggest that there is no room for hawkish surprises. Political uncertainty ranging from a no-deal Brexit to the US-China trade war has been reduced, and as such, it has given the global economy a chance to recover. The IMF’s World Economic Outlook confirmed that a trend of global stabilization is taking place, though the coronavirus could derail the trajectory. The potency of fear about the coronavirus impacting financial markets has shown to have varying degrees of influence that is in large are predicated on the nature of the news. More specifically, the severity of the updates. Last week, news about the new method of calculating the number of cases added several thousand more to those infected, causing S&P 500 futures to retreat with NOK and SEK while the anti-risk JPY and USD rose. We may see a similar dynamic like this play out in the week ahead, whereby an update on the Wuhan virus may elicit a strong risk-off bias and push commodity-linked FX lower at the expense of anti-risk assets. In the coming weeks, what investors will be eager to see what the estimated numbers will be for China Q1 GDP since it may reveal how the virus has impacted the Asian giant’s growth. The Swedish Krona face selling pressure if Swedish CPI data for January underwhelms in addition to the publication of unemployment data. While the Riksbank has said it would first use non-negative interest rate measures to counter a downturn first, unexpectedly soft price growth and shaky jobs data could cause officials to reconsider. A higher unemployment rate could also expose a growing threat in the financial system. As outlined in my US Dollar weekly forecast, the Greenback may rise against its major counterparts, particularly those that have a predisposed sensitivity to oscillations in global sentiment. While the petroleum-linked Norwegian Krone has sometimes benefited from politically-induced supply disruption fears, the recent escalation of tension between Iran and the US has led to a selloff in NOK against USD and JPY. The assassination of the Iranian General Qasem Soleimani is the most recent example. After reports confirmed the official was killed, crude oil prices rose on the expectation that a heightened conflict between the US and Iran would choke supply and push prices higher. In the upcoming election, conservative hardliners are expected to win a larger number of seats Parliament, potentially raising the prospect of conflict down the line. USD/SEK is trading on the lower cusp of the trend-defining resistance area between 9.7228 and 9.6878 (gold-dotted lines). If the pair fails to clear resistance with follow-through, the next area USD/SEK will likely test will be the January uptrend. If broken, it may precede a bearish correction. As the range between resistance and the slope of appreciation narrows, traders get closer to seeing if a bearish or bullish move is up ahead. USD/SEK – Daily Chart USD/SEK chart created using TradingView As outlined in last week’s forecast, USD/NOK broke below the January uptrend, but its decline has not been very aggressive – at least so far. This may therefore speak to an underlying bullish bias propelling the pair higher as it treads below resistance at 9.3057. The upcoming FOMC meeting may be the catalyst needed to catapult the pair beyond the ceiling rather than retreating to support at 9.2007.

5e5d08d3bd5d9d5ac07275dc	Euro Forecast Gloomy as DAX Breaks Trend-Defining Support	Asia-Pacific equities were mixed early into Wednesday’s trading session after Wall Street endured another aggressive selloff. USD/KRW rose again and is up over five percent since the start of the coronavirus outbreak after news broke that the export-oriented country reported over 1,000 confirmed cases – up from 51 a week ago. On balance, risk aversion is elevated with Asian CDS spreads on corporate entities at a three-week high. EURO OUTLOOK BEARISH VS SWISS FRANC The Euro may continue to decline against the Swiss Franc as EUR/CHF trades at a five-year low and is approaching critical cross section as the spread of the coronavirus stokes demand for anti-risk assets. Italy has reported 322 cases of COVID-19 and has shut down 10 towns in an effort to reduce the probability of regional contagion.

5e5d083673d82f5acc8afc54	Is it Time for an Emergency Fed Rate Cut? Traders Sure Think So!	After all the turmoil in markets last week, traders are seemingly taking a pause in early trade this morning. Equity indices across Asia, Europe, and the US are either trading higher or pointing to a higher open, the “safe haven” Japanese yen is the weakest major currency so far today, and oil is rallying by 3%. While the two-day weekend break from trading certainly helped to “cool off” emotions, the biggest factor stabilizing markets is the belief that central bankers will ride to the rescue once again. At the Asian open, the Bank of Japan issued a brief statement acknowledging that, “Global financial and capital markets have been unstable recently with growing uncertainties about the outlook for economic activity due to the spread of the novel coronavirus” and vowing to “closely monitor future developments, and… strive to provide ample liquidity and ensure stability in financial markets through appropriate market operations and asset purchases.” The central bank subsequently injected ¥500B in two-week funds to support markets. Looking ahead, the proverbial elephant in the room will be the Federal Reserve. In an unscheduled statement of his own on Friday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the Fed would “act as appropriate” to support the economy in the face of risks posed by the epidemic. Following last week’s massive selloff in risk assets, traders believe Powell was hinting at an imminent interest rate cut, perhaps even before the Fed’s scheduled meeting in two weeks’ time. As the chart below shows, US interest rates have fallen off a cliff in recent days, with the 1-year, 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year tenors all shedding at least 40bps over the last two weeks alone. Source: TradingView, GAIN Capital For reference, the last time the Fed Funds rate was higher than the entire US yield curve (as we saw briefly last night) was in 2008, in the midst of the Great Financial Crisis. At the moment, the March Fed Funds rate is trading at 1.25%, nearly 40 bps below the current Fed funds rate of 1.62%, signaling that traders believe the central bank will be cutting interest rates dramatically and rapidly, perhaps as soon as today or later this week. Make no mistake: situations like this are exactly why the Federal Reserve raised interest rates off 0% over the last few years, and the central bank will not be afraid to use the (limited) ammo it has at its disposal. Indeed, the Fed could very well take interest rates below 1.00% this summer in an effort to cushion the blow of coronavirus-related economic disruptions. For the FX market, this means that the US dollar’s relative yield advantage over its G10 rivals could soon evaporate, and traders have been consistently selling the greenback as a result. After probing 100.00 less than two weeks ago, the US Dollar Index has fallen six of the past seven days to trade back at its 200-day EMA near 97.75. If the Fed does follow through with a 50bps interest rate cut, either this week or at its regularly-scheduled meeting in two weeks’ time, the dollar could finally bounce in a “sell-the-rumor-buy-the-news” reaction. That said, the near-term momentum has clearly shifted in favor of the bears, and if the dollar index breaks below its 200-day EMA near 97.70, a move toward the bottom of the 1-year range near 96.00 could be next.

5e95d3088dba6e62949f0807	Dollar slips as risk appetite returns to market	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell to two-week lows against a basket of currencies on Tuesday as risk sentiment returned to the market following better-than-expected economic data from China, which painted a less gloomy picture than feared following the coronavirus outbreak there. China’s March exports fell 6.6% from a year earlier, compared with a forecast for a 14% drop, while imports fell by less than 1%, compared with a 9.5% drop predicted by economists. “The dollar has retained a moderate softening bias amid a context of risk-on positioning and with global markets returning to full participation following the long weekends in many financial centres in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Chinese trade data for March provided bullish fodder for stock markets in Asia by showing an abatement in the rate of decline in imports and exports after the severe plunges in January and February,” wrote analysts at Action Economics. Daily fatalities in the United States also fell sharply, and states began making plans to reopen their economies, leaving traders to abandon the safety net of the highly liquid dollar and turn to riskier currencies. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six rivals =USD, fell 0.50% to 98.90. The euro EUR= gained 0.62% against the greenback to $1.0981. The Australian dollar AUD=, which is sensitive to Chinese demand because of the country's dependence on raw materials exports, rose to a more than one-month high and last traded at $0.6432, up 0.80% on the day. The greenback slipped 0.52% against the Japanese yen JPY= to 107.2 yen. “The ongoing improvement in global investor risk sentiment in the near term combined with the Fed’s aggressive policy response is beginning to weigh down more on the U.S. dollar,” said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG. The mood in the foreign exchange markets was pre-empted by leveraged funds, whose net short U.S. dollar positioning in the latest week touched its largest level since May 2018, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. The value of the net short dollar position was $10.5 billion in the week ended April 7, from net shorts of $9.9 billion the previous week. Speculators have been short on the U.S. dollar for four consecutive weeks. Graphic: Speculators go even shorter on US dollar here Graphic: FX positions here Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve rolled out a $2.3 trillion effort to bolster local governments and small and mid-sized businesses in its latest move to keep the U.S. economy intact as the country battles the coronavirus pandemic. The Fed’s latest efforts have added to current dollar weakness, analysts say.

5e5d08052e1fe5553d2b63d4	A Busy Economic Calendar Puts the EUR in the Spotlight	It was another relatively busy day on the economic calendar through the Asian session this morning. Key stats included 3rd quarter employment figures out of New Zealand and October Service sector PMI numbers out of China. Employment rose by 0.2%, quarter-on-quarter, in the 3rd quarter, following a 0.8% increase in the 2nd quarter. Economists had forecast a 0.3% rise. The unemployment rate rose from 3.9% to 4.2% in the 3rd quarter, which was worse than a forecast of 4.1%. According to NZ Stats, The Kiwi Dollar moved from $0.63791 to $0.63742 upon release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Kiwi Dollar was down by 0.11% to $0.6368. The Services PMI fell from a prelim 50.3 to 49.7 in October, according to finalized numbers. In September, the Services PMI had stood at 52.8. According to the October Survey, The Japanese Yen moved from ¥109.113 to ¥109.124 upon release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Japanese Yen was up by 0.12% to ¥109.03 against the U.S Dollar. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was down by 0.07% to $0.6888. It’s a busy day ahead on the economic calendar. Key stats due out of the Eurozone includes German factory orders, Spanish and Italian service sector PMIs for October and the Eurozone’s finalized service and composite PMI and retail sales figures. Finalized Service PMIs are also due out of France and Germany. We would expect the Eurozone’s service and composite PMI, factory orders and retail sales figures to have the greatest impact. At the time of writing, the EUR was down by 0.02% to $1.1073. It’s a quiet day ahead on the data front. There are no material stats due out of the UK to provide direction for the Pound. A lack of stats leaves the Pound in the hands of UK politics on the day as the markets look ahead to tomorrow’s BoE policy decision. At the time of writing, the Pound was down by 0.03% to $1.2880. It’s a relatively busy day ahead on the economic calendar. Key stats include 3rd quarter nonfarm productivity and unit labor cost figures. Outside of the numbers, geopolitics will continue to be an influence on the day. The Dollar Spot Index was down by 0.06% to 97.921 at the time of writing. It’s a relatively quiet day on the economic calendar. Canada’s Ivey PMI for October is due out later today. Following a quiet start to the week, we can expect the Loonie to be responsive to today’s stat. The weekly EIA crude oil inventory numbers will also provide direction later in the day. The Loonie was up by 0.01% to C$1.3156, against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing.	EUR
5e6f91a3c0d1010a982ed5cb	Central Banks Take Coordinated Action: USD/JPY Reacts	As central banks around the world have acted to stem the economic fallout from the global threat of the coronavirus, one of the most volatile currency pairs has been the USD/JPY. As you may be aware the US Federal Reserve has taken unprecedented emergency measures by cutting interest rates to a 0-25% range and has announced a new $700B QE program. The BoJ has taken measures of their own by doubling its ETF target to JPY 12 trillion! In addition, BoJ Governor Kuroda indicated that they will increase the amount of corporate bonds they will be buying. They have also introduced a new zero rate loan facility. Some of these moves appear to be taken as a sign of desperation central bank, as stock markets around the world are tumbling and US stocks open limit down. As a result, USD/JPY has been moving lower in a flight to safety move. On Friday, the pair reached as high as 108.50. However, on the open, the pair gapped lower with stocks and has traded as low as 105.15. On a daily timeframe, we can see that after spiking through the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the February 20th highs to the March 9th lows near 108.04, price has moved 300 pips lower today into a band of support between 105.50 and 105.00. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com On a 240-minute timeframe, we can see that the upward move has created a channel and price is currently threatening to break lower. However, this is NOT a flag formation as price has retraced too much off the lows. In order to be considered a flag formation, price should not retrace more than 50% of the move. If price does break lower from here, the next support isn’t down until 103. Resistance is up at the highs of the day near 107.50, then Friday’s highs near 108.50. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com The range on the day for USD/JPY is already over 225 pips and the pair is down -2.25% (that is a large move in percentage terms for a currency pair). However, the RSI on both the daily and the 240-minute chart is in neutral territory. Therefore, price still has room to run to the downside. This will be an interesting pair to watch going forward as we have seen over the last few days that DXY has also become a flight to safety. If traders feel that the US Dollar is a “safer” currency than JPY, the pair could reverse and trade higher, even if stocks continue lower!	JPY
5e958d19137dd6726bef5628	Indonesia: IDR stability should reopen the door for further rate cuts – ANZ	Citing the need to maintain external stability, Bank Indonesia (BI) kept its policy rate unchanged today, per ANZ Bank. USD/IDR is trading at 15,726.00. “Today’s status quo on rates was contrary to street expectations which forecasted a third consecutive cut.” “The growth picture painted by the central bank was expectedly dire, with the 2020 GDP forecast reduced to 2.3%.” “The BI forecast a reduction in the current account deficit to even 1.5% of GDP in Q1 2020. This extent of reduction, combined with dollar bond sales, bodes well for IDR stability which in turn, should reopen the door for further rate cuts.” “We are retaining our forecast for a 25bp rate cut in Q2.”	IDR
5e9455649425b21efdefe34c	Week ahead: Investors continued buying stocks	This week’s Market News Report will be a little shorter than usual. Last week’s economic data releases have revealed more coronavirus damage to the economy. Thursday’s weekly Unemployment Claims number has been close to 7 million once again! Two weeks ago it was the first data to show impact of the pandemic on the U.S. economy. And we will likely get more bad economic data in the future. However, the markets remained relatively calm last week, as investors continued buying stocks. What about the coming week? Let’s take a look at key highlights: The markets will likely pay most attention to Wednesday’s U.S. Retail Sales and Thursday’s Unemployment Claims releases. We will also get the China’s GDP number on Wednesday. On Wednesday there will also be important economic data releases from Australia and Canada. Last but not the least, oil traders will await Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s inventories data release. You will find this week’s the key news releases below (EST time zone). For your convenience, we broken them down per market to which they are particularly important, so that you know what to pay extra attention to, if you have or plan to have positions in one of them. Moreover, we put the particularly important news in bold. This kind of news is what is more likely to trigger volatile movements. The news that are not in bold usually don’t result in bigger intraday moves, so unless one is engaging in a particularly active form of day trading, it might be best to focus on the news that we put in bold. Of course, you are free to use the below indications as you see fit. As far as we are concerned, we are usually not engaging in any day trading during days with “bold” events on a given market. However, in case of more medium-term trades, we usually choose to be aware of the increased intraday volatility, but not change the currently opened position. Our Market News Report consists of two different time-related perspectives. The investors’ perspective is only suitable for the long-term investments. The single economic data releases rarely cause major outlook changes. Hence, we will only see a handful of bold markings every week. On the other hand, the traders’ perspective is for traders and day-traders, because the assets’ prices are likely to react on a single piece of economic data. So, there will be a lot more bold markings on potentially market-moving news every week. 8:30 a.m. U.S. - Unemployment Claims 10:00 p.m. China - GDP q/y 8:30 a.m. U.S. - Retail Sales m/m, Core Retail Sales m/m 10:30 a.m. U.S. - Crude Oil Inventories 8:30 a.m. U.S. - Unemployment Claims 10:00 p.m. China - GDP q/y 8:30 a.m. U.S. - Unemployment Claims 10:00 p.m. China - GDP q/y 8:30 a.m. U.S. - Retail Sales m/m, Core Retail Sales m/m 10:00 a.m. Canada - Overnight Rate, BOC Monetary Policy Report, BOC Rate Statement 11:15 a.m. Canada - BOC Press Conference 8:30 a.m. U.S. - Unemployment Claims 10:00 p.m. China - GDP q/y Summing up, the financial markets will likely continue to react to news about globally spreading corona virus in the near future. The scheduled economic data releases seem less important than monetary policy updates or news about governments’ interventions recently. However, if you’re an investor and not a trader, you should pay extra attention to Wednesday’s economic data releases from Australia and Canada. In addition, this week’s Retail Sales and Unemployment Claims releases may show further virus impact on the U.S. economy.

5e95366436d4d432739206f7	Australia's treasury expects jobless rate to hit 10% in June quarter	"The Federal Treasury expects the coronavirus pandemic to push 1.4 million out of work in the second quarter and boost the jobless rate to 10 percent, according to Australian Associated Press. ""Unemployment at that rate - hundreds of thousands of people losing their jobs - it is just absolutely heartbreaking,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Tuesday. The jobless rate could have tripled to 15% were it not for the government's $130 billion wage subsidy scheme, according to Treasury's estimates. More than 800,000 Australian businesses have registered for the JobKeeper program that passed parliament last week. More than 700,000 Australians are expected to lose their jobs before the middle of this year because of the coronavirus pandemic."	AUD
5e5d0841bd5d9d5ac07275ab	S&P 500 Outlook Grim, Studies Warn US Stocks to Keep Falling	Retail traders appear to be betting that recent stock market losses present a buying opportunity. IG Client Sentiment (IGCS) statistics show sharp gains in long exposure on contracts tracking bellwether US equity benchmarks – the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average – as well as France’s analogous CAC 40 and Germany’s DAX 30. See the full IGCS sentiment report here. The number of IG traders betting on US stock market gains rose by close to 70 percent compared with last week, while net-long exposure to instruments tracing the path of French and German shares surged 166.2 and 108.6 percent over the same period. IGCS is typically a contrarian indicator, so the swell in buying suggests equity markets may continue to face selling pressure. Technical positioning seems to support the case for weakness. The appearance of negative RSI divergence preceded a broad-based downturn, as expected. The culprit has been flagged as the outbreak of the Wuhan-strain coronavirus, although it might be argued that it acted as a trigger for an already-brewing shakeout rather than a stand-alone catalyst. The pace-setting S&P 500 index has sliced through support levels defining the upward trajectory since the beginning of 2019, signaling a substantial trend reversal is afoot. A daily close below the next support later in the 2806-25 area targets barriers at 2726.50 and in the 2603-26 zone thereafter. Reclaiming a foothold above 3029.50 seems like a prerequisite for taming immediate selling pressure.

5e83466c0a93c67d669fb506	Asian markets mostly rise after Wall Street rally, encouraging factory data from China	Asian shares were mostly higher Tuesday after a rally in U.S. stocks, mostly spurred by health care companies’ announcements of developments that could aid in the coronavirus outbreak. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 NIK, +0.65% gave up early gains and was last down in morning trading. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, -1.64% fell 0.4%, while South Korea’s Kospi 180721, +0.61% picked up 1.7%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng HSI, +0.27% was up 1.2% and the Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +1.74% gained 0.4%. Benchmark indexes in Taiwan Y9999, +1.53% , Singapore STI, +1.39% and Indonesia JAKIDX, -1.35% gained. “Despite some respite for markets overnight, uncertainty remains as the spread of the COVID-19 virus continues,” said Zhu Huani at Mizuho Bank, warning against too much optimism. “Central banks and authorities continue to step up measures to support the economy.” In Asia, the Monetary Authority of Singapore eased policy Monday, and the central bank of China has also cut a key interest rate. Official data also showed that China’s manufacturing activity and service sector bounced back stronger than expected in March, as businesses reopened after the coronavirus shutdown. The overnight rally on Wall Street tacked more gains onto a recent upswing for the market, which is coming off the best week for the S&P 500 in 11 years, albeit after falling into bear market territory. Optimism is budding that the worst of the selling may be approaching, but markets around the world are still wary as leaders work to nurse their economies through the pandemic. The S&P 500 remains 22.4% below its record set last month, and oil tumbled to an 18-year low. The S&P 500 rose 3.4% Monday for its fourth gain in the last five days. “The market wants to see everything line up, and last week everything lined up,” said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at Edward Jones, referring to the unprecedented aid from the Fed and Congress. Now, she said, President Donald Trump also appears to be in sync with health experts about the need to restrict the economy to slow the spread of the virus. Trump on Sunday extended social-distancing guidelines, which recommend against group gatherings larger than 10, through the end of April. Earlier, he had said he wanted the economy open by Easter. “Now that message is in line,” said Richardson. “All these things line up coming into this week, and that’s why you saw strong performance last week continuing today.” The S&P 500 SPX, +7.03% rose 85.18 points to 2,626.65. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +7.73% gained 3.2% to 22,327.48, and the Nasdaq COMP, +7.32% gained 3.6%, to 7,774.15. “We have to look at this rally suspiciously,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for CFRA. He pointed to prior bear markets where stocks rallied more than 20% only to fall to new lows. “Granted, this bear is like no other,” he said. “There are too many uncertainties out there for the market masses to have concluded that March 23 was the ultimate bottom.” Still, the 17.4% surge for stocks since last Monday has brought the first green shoots of optimism. Economists expect a number of weak reports on the economy to come in through the week. The lowlight will likely be Friday’s jobs report, where economists expect to see the steepest drop in the nation’s payrolls since the Great Recession. Benchmark U.S. crude CLK20, +3.37% added $1.44 to $21.53. It fell 6.6% to $20.09 a barrel Monday, after touching its lowest price since 2002. May Brent crude BRNK20, -0.21% , the global benchmark, rose 1.5%. Oil started the year above $60 and has plunged on expectations that a weakened economy will burn less fuel. The world is awash in oil, meanwhile, as producers continue to pull more of it out of the ground. The dollar USDJPY, -0.34% was trading at $108.50, down from $107.57 Monday.

5e5d31b7d3c8fc0aa1ab81d7	NZD/USD Bulls Are Salivating	New Zealand is the latest to fall victim to the coronavirus. A woman in her 60s who traveled from Iran to Auckland via Bali tested positive for the virus on Friday. NZD/USD was down 1.1% Friday, gunning for its October 1 low near .6200. The lows of 2015 are .6193 as well. From a trading point of view, NZD/USD bulls will be looking to buy near this level, placing stops below the 2015 lows. Why? Because there is tremendous risk/reward potential. If one buys near .6230, and risks 50 pips, that trader may look for a target of .6430 (or more) – or the 38.2% retracement from the December 31 highs to Friday’s low. That’s a risk/reward of 1:4, which is risking 50 to make 200. Bulls may look to take advantage of the risk/reward near the lows. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com On the shorter 240-minute timeframe, let’s say a trader wants to risk less. This trader has to be patient and wait for the market to “come to them,” near the .6200 level. The trader, for example, only wants to risk 20 pips. He or she may wait and buy at .6205 and place stops below the 2015 lows at .6185. Horizontal resistance appears to be at .6284. So, if this trader places a take-profit order at .6275 (or more), the risk/reward would be 1:3.5, that is, risking 20 to make 75. The RSI is diverging with price, but in this hyper volatile market and oscillators should not be used alone (or even at all). But again, bulls may look to take advantage of the risk/reward near the lows. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Whether one is bullish or bearish, each trader has their own risk tolerances. That is something each trader must decide for himself or herself. Sometimes, when things look to be at their worst, they may actually turn out to be the best. As long as traders use proper risk management (NZD/USD bulls in this case), trades can have large upside potential, or minimal loss. In this case, bulls may be looking for support near the lows to try and make that happen.	NZD
5e7922991b0aa150d18005f2	Dollar edges higher as investors wait on fiscal stimulus	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained on Monday as investors waited on U.S. fiscal stimulus to blunt the impact of business shutdowns designed to halt the spread of the coronavirus, even after the Federal Reserve took unprecedented measures to support lending. In a series of actions the Fed agreed to historical measures that would see it for the first time back the purchases of corporate bonds and direct loans to companies, expand its asset holding by as much as needed to stabilise financial markets, and roll out “soon” a program to get credit to small and midsize business. The dollar dropped sharply when the measures were announced, but gradually climbed back as investors looked to the government to launch stimulus. “The one thing we really need to see is more fiscal ammunition coming to the fore,” said Mazen Issa, senior currency strategist at TD Securities in New York. “You’ve got to think about those that are asked to be socially distant and stay home from work and not earn a paycheck and they’re taking their time to make them whole. They need to speed it up.” A far-reaching coronavirus economic stimulus package failed to advance in the U.S. Senate on Monday as Democrats said it contained too little money for hospitals and not enough restrictions on a fund to help big businesses. The dollar index against a basket of peers =USD fell as low as 101.64 on the announcement of new Fed support, before rising back to trade at 101.53, up 0.03% on the day. Multiple central bank actions over the past week have so far been unable to stem dollar strength, or offset stock weakness. The U.S. currency’s gains have also been fueled by a turnaround in dollar positions among hedge funds to a net short from an overall long bet, according to the latest positioning data. That has stirred speculation the dollar’s rally could be partly explained by short-covering by traders.

5e81b5ffc496d2354de7302c	Central banks dovish stance	Aside from waiting for a trade accord between China and the U.S, this was a busy week for central bank’s monetary policy announcements. At China’s National People’s Congress, authorities lowered their 2019 economic growth target to a range of +6.0-6.5% amid rising concerns over a downturn in the world’s second largest economy and will aim for consumer inflation of +3% this year and a fiscal deficit of +2.8%. Down-under, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Lowe signaled it is hard to think rates will rise after Australia’s Q4 2018 GDP reading was the weakest quarterly reading in three-years. Even the U.S was not immune from growth worries, now that the U.S trade gap with the rest of the world jumped to a 10-year high of +$621B (£472.5bn) last year. Exports to the rest of the world fell -1.9% to +$205.1bn, while imports rose by 2.1% to $262.9bn. The Bank of Canada (BoC) took the market by surprises and was very “dovish.” Governor Poloz held its key interest rate steady at +1.75% as weaker global and domestic growth prospects led policy makers to express more caution about the pace of future rate increases. He insists that the economic outlook continues “to warrant a policy rate that is below the neutral range, which is currently estimated around 2.5% to 3.5%.” ECB’s President Draghi was not going to be left behind other G7 central banks. The ECB surprised everyone by announcing a new series of refinancing operations and delaying when it expects to raise interest rates. Euro policy makers now say interest rates will remain at their present levels “at least through the end of 2019” versus “at least through the summer of 2019” at its previous statement. They also announced new targeted longer-term refinancing operations on a quarterly basis, starting in September 2019 and ending in March 2021.

5e616b6774f70e4eadd2ce97	JPY: When Will Japan Act?	An interesting weekly report came out of Japan early in Asia today, which said that stock investments by foreigners fell by JPY -755B during the week of February 29 vs. JPY -68.1B in the prior week. This is the largest withdrawal of funds from Japanese stocks since September 22, 2019. In addition, foreign bond investment fell by JPY -489.7B during the week of February 29 vs. JPY +656.3B a week earlier. However, the yen is still maintaining its “flight-to-safety” quality, at least until the Bank of Japan decides to provide further stimulus. Market News International reported that officials signaled Japan doesn’t need additional stimulus until USD/JPY falls sharply through 105.00. The BoJ doesn’t meet again until March 18/19. The U.S. Federal Reserve cut rates on Tuesday by 50bps to 1.25%. After the GPIF was in the market during mid-February selling yen and buying counter currencies, USD/JPY began to tank, and fear of the coronavirus began spreading around the globe. USD/JPY came off from above 112.00 to today's levels are near 106.50. There is horizontal support near today's lows, but the bearish outside engulfing candle on the day (so far) isn’t showing much promise for the pair to bounce significantly. Next support is a rising weekly trendline near 105.50 dating back to mid-2016. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) also cut rates this week by 25bps, to an a new all-time low of 0.50%. On a 240-minute timeframe, AUD/JPY broke lower out of the flag pattern dating back to mid-January and halted near the target of 70.00. Price bounced to near 71.50, turned lower and formed a new pennant-like formation. Today, the pair broke lower again, moving toward target near 68.60. AUD/JPY must first break the previous lows of 69.40 on its way to target. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Finally, the Bank of Canada cut rates yesterday by 50bps from 1.75% to 1.25% and they still have additional room to move if needed. CAD/JPY as been moving lower from its highs of 84.75 in mid-February (the same time USD/JPY began moving lower). The pair has stalled at the 161.8% Fibonacci extension level from the lows on February 3 to the highs on February 20, near 79.50. If price breaks through here, it could move quickly to the lows of August 26, 2019 near 78.50. First resistance is the lows from earlier this week near 80.00. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Although the Bank of Japan hasn’t showed signs it would provide more stimulus until its meeting in mid-March, there is always the chance it could convene a inter-meeting and provide support (as the Fed did). However, one must wonder how much more it can do, as it has been supporting the economy for over 20 years. But, if the BoJ wants the yen to weaken, it’ll need to do something soon!	JPY
5e70dbe263314c46898ba11d	Dollar surges as companies scramble for liquidity	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar surged on Tuesday as companies and investors sought out the most liquid currency as concerns about economic shutdowns from the coronavirus continued to dent risk appetite. The Federal Reserve on Sunday slashed rates to zero and launched a new bond purchase program. Other central banks have taken similar measures but the moves have so far failed to stem liquidity strains and market panic. Central banks have also cut pricing on their swap lines to make it easier to provide dollars to financial institutions around the world. But funding markets show continued stress in sourcing the greenback. Three-month euro/dollar cross-currency basis swap spreads EURCBS3M=ICAP rose as high as 120 basis points, up from less than 90 on Monday and putting the spread as its widest since late 2011 - the height of the euro zone debt crisis. “Stress here is helping lift the USD,” said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto. The U.S. currency had initially fallen in early March as U.S. government bond yields tumbled, but the dollar has since rebounded, and measured against a basket of major currencies is now up around 5% since March 9. The dollar index =USD was last at 99.43, up 1.33% on the day. Investors are looking for the Fed to support to the commercial paper market, which companies tap for short-term loans, and for governments to launch new fiscal stimulus to help offset an economic downturn. President Donald Trump’s administration and leading Republicans urged the Senate on Monday to swiftly back a House-passed coronavirus aid plan and seriously consider massive new economic stimulus legislation that was still under development. Data on Tuesday showed that U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in February, with households cutting back on purchases of a range of products, and the coronavirus outbreak is expected to depress sales in the months ahead. The euro EUR= dropped 1.63% to $1.10. The dollar rallied 1% versus the yen to 106.91 yen JPY=. The Australian dollar AUD=, which is sensitive to global growth due to the country's commodities exports, fell 1.70% to $0.6013, its weakest since 2003. It is down 10% since March 9. The Reserve Bank of Australia has reiterated it stands ready to ease policy further in the face of the unprecedented spread of the coronavirus, adding to speculation about aggressive stimulus measures this week.

5e7a18a161ed8b55ee1341b2	Dow Surges Despite Record Plunge in Markit PMI on Coronavirus	Stocks surged at the New York opening bell on Tuesday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq jumping 6.3%, 5.1% and 5.0% respectively. Investors have grown increasingly hopeful that US Congress will ink a coronavirus stimulus bill to offset economic impact from the global pandemic. This follows news from the Federal Reserve yesterday detailing unlimited QE as the central bank steps in to provide massive amounts of liquidity to shore up panic-stuck markets. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView Stocks remain about 30% off all-time highs recorded last month, however, as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) wreaks havoc on the global economy. Economic data is just starting to trickle in detailing how gloomy coronavirus fallout has been. On that note, the IHS Markit PMI reading for March just crossed the wires, which revealed the flash composite output index crashed to 40.5 – a new series low. The services business activity index plunged to 39.1, also a new series low, while the manufacturing PMI fell to 49.2, a 127-month low. According to commentary from Chris Williamson, IHS Markit Chief Business Economist, the flash PMI data “underscores how the US is likely already in a recession that will inevitably deepen further.” Read More: Gold Price to Resume Ascent as Fed Asset Purchases Balloon -- Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight	USD

5e6f91a3c0d1010a982ed5c8	Chart Of The Day: U.S. Dollar Likely To Whipsaw Wildly Before Setting Trend	The Federal Reserve made another emergency cut yesterday, slashing rates by 100 basis points to close to 0% for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis. The U.S. central bank also launched a massive, $700 billion bond buying plan. The dollar dropped, paring half of Friday’s 1.3% surge, which had sealed its best week since 2008. The fundamentals are pretty straightforward. However, the technical picture is confusing. On the one hand, the dollar climbed back into a rising channel in place since July 2018. On the other, it has been developing a broadening pattern. An uptrend means that both price peaks and troughs head higher, while a downtrend is defined by both highs and lows tracking lower. A broadening pattern occurs when highs climb and lows drop, which makes it a sideways move. However, since this pattern appears at market tops, it's considered bearish: buyers lose patience when the lows don’t join the highs with higher prices and they eventually join the sellers. Nonetheless, equities entered both a bear market and a downtrend. In practical terms that means declines should be trusted while rallies are suspect. In this scenario they're nothing more than corrective moves higher within a downtrend—fueled by profit-taking or short covering that increases demand and those hopeful enough to be willing to trade against the trend. U.S. futures also sank 5% today, triggering limit-downs and suggesting the underlying indices will continue selling off as the coronavirus pandemic intensifies worldwide, with more businesses announcing mass store closings. In previous crashes, the dollar became the ultimate safe haven asset, and we expect it to become that again. However, we do anticipate it will whipsaw violently before establishing a clear trend, up or down. Conservative traders would wait for two rising highs and lows to buy, or for two falling highs and lows to short. Moderate traders would go long after an upside breakout, which consolidates a base above the sideways patterns. Alternatively, they would do the same thing upon a downside breakout and a return move toward the pattern that fails, solidifying a top. Or they may go long if the dollar either falls to 95, the pattern bottom, or passes 100, providing an upside breakout to the sideways move. Aggressive traders may buy if the price returns toward the bottom of the pattern and after breaking its topside. Trade Sample	USD
5e81b63dc496d2354de73076	Sterling plummets on Brexit resignations	Thursday November 15: Five things the markets are talking about Earlier this morning U.K Brexit Minister Dominic Raab resigned, a day after PM May’s Cabinet agreed the wording of a post-Brexit trade deal between the U.K and the E.U. Raab said he could not support, in good conscience, his former leaders deal. Sterling was immediately hit for six, falling -1.55% to £1.2785. The market was expecting some resignations, but not such a high profile individual to kick things off. PM May can now expect more resignations, which would lead to a vote of no confidence and throws the future course of Brexit into uncertainty. Future scenarios range from a calm divorce to rejection of May’s deal, potentially ending her leadership and leaving the bloc with no agreement, or another referendum. Elsewhere, Japanese equities edged lower, while Hong Kong shares jumped on corporate earnings, while Chinese equities outperformed on the announcement of potential concessions to the Trump administration. U.S equity futures start better bid after Fed Chair Powell painted an upbeat picture of the world’s biggest economy last night. 1. Stocks mixed results Global stocks have mostly ‘stabilized’ after a recent selloff, even as ongoing Brexit developments drove sharp swings in the European markets. In Japan, the Nikkei fell on Thursday, with banking stocks sliding after disappointing earnings forecasts and losses in U.S financial shares Wednesday. The Nikkei share average ended -0.2% lower, while the broader Topix was down -0.1%. Ex-Japan, stocks were broadly higher on reports that China made an opening bid to the U.S on trade, as well as upbeat results in the technology sector. Shares of Tencent Holdings rallied +5.8% after reporting a better-than-expected +30% rise in profits. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rallied +1.75%, the Shanghai Composite Index rose +1.4% and South Korea’s Kospi climbed +1%. Down-under, a late-afternoon rebound in Aussie stocks pushed the benchmark back into positive territory at the day’s end. The ASX S&P 200-rallied +0.06%, supported mostly by an overnight uptick in crude oil prices. In Europe, regional bourses trade mixed, with the FTSE outperforming on the back of a steep drop in the pound (£1.2790, -1.7%) after initial strength following yesterday’s cabinet agreement on the wording of a post-Brexit deal. U.S stocks are set to open in the ‘black’ (+0.1%). Indices: Stoxx600 -0.65% at 359.90, FTSE -0.09% at 7,027.45, DAX -0.20% at 11,390.06, CAC-40 -0.52% at 5,042.74, IBEX-35 -0.54% at 9,057.35, FTSE MIB -0.66% at 18,952.50, SMI -0.32% at 8,907.50, S&P 500 Futures +0.01% 2. Oil prices stabilize, but supply glut concerns weigh on sentiment, gold steady Oil prices are trading somewhat stabile, reversing overnight declines, but investors remain cautious over concerns that a supply glut may emerge. Brent crude oil is trading at +$66.17 per barrel, up +5c from Wednesday’s close, while U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures are at +$56.29 a barrel, up +4c from yesterday’s close. Note: Brent soared to a four-year high of +$86.74 in early October as the market waited for U.S sanctions on Iran, but prices have plummeted -25% in the last four-weeks. OPEC warned earlier this week that a supply glut could emerge in 2019 as the world economy slows and rivals increase production more quickly than expected. Led by top exporter Saudi Arabia, OPEC has been making more public statements of late that they would start withholding crude next year to tighten supply and prop up prices. In its monthly report Wednesday, IEA left its forecast for global demand growth for 2018 and 2019 unchanged from last month at +1.3M and +1.4M bpd, respectively, but cut its forecast for non-OECD demand growth. For H1 2019, based on its outlook for non-OPEC production and global demand, and assuming flat OPEC production, the IEA said the “implied stock build is +2M bpd.” Note: Both OPEC and Russia are under pressure to reduce current production levels; this decision could be taken at the next OPEC meeting on Dec. 6. Ahead of the U.S open, gold prices trade somewhat steady, after rising nearly +1% Wednesday, as the ‘big’ dollar eases away from its 16-month peak print earlier in the week. Spot gold is little changed at +$1,211.12 per ounce, while U.S gold futures have inched up +0.1% at +$1,211.7 per ounce. 3. Brexit worries support demand for Bunds German Bund yields have tumbled to a new two-week low ahead of the open stateside after U.K Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resigned, pushing PM May’s government into turmoil. The German 10-year Bund yield is down -4.5 bps at +0.36%, its lowest in over two -weeks. Borrowing costs in Spain, Italy and Portugal are backing up as the market stays away from riskier assets after this morning’s developments in the U.K. Note: Euro leaders are expected to meet on Nov. 25 to endorse Britain’s divorce deal, but will there be one to ratify? Yields on U.K 10-year Gilts fell -13 bps to +1.39% from +1.52%, while the yield on U.S 10-year Treasuries fell -2 bps to +3.10%, hitting the lowest in more than two-weeks with its fifth straight decline. Elsewhere, the spread of Italy’s 10-year BTP’s over Germany’s Bunds increased +4 bps to +3.1352% to the biggest premium in more than three-weeks. 4. Investors short the pound on Brexit uncertainty Uncertainty over whether PM May will be able to deliver a Brexit deal after two cabinet members resigned this morning and talks of increased support for a no-confidence vote has encouraged the market to sell the pound. GBP/USD has fallen -1.55% to £1.2785, while EUR/GBP has rallied +1.40% to €0.8828. In case there is a no-deal Brexit, the pound is expected to plunge dramatically, so much so, that the pound ‘bears’ are speculating that that it could take EUR/GBP to €1.00 – €1.10 region. It would mean that the U.K would end up with a trade relationship with the E.U based on WTO regulations. Elsewhere, the EUR has climbed +0.1% to €1.1317, while the Japanese yen has increased +0.1% to ¥113.41, the strongest in more than a week. 5. U.K retail sales fall in October Data from the ONS this morning showed that U.K retail sales declined in October for the second-consecutive month. This would suggest that the U.K consumer is “tightening their belts.” Retail sales fell -0.5% in October m/m and digging deeper, the headline print reflects sliding sales of clothing and household goods. Comparing the three-months through October to the three-months through September, retail sales growth slowed to +0.4% from +1.2%, the fourth-straight slowdown over a three-month period. Prior to today’s surprised Brexit resignations, both the BoE and IMF had expected the U.K economy to grow modestly next year as it begins restructuring its economic ties with the E.U after its withdrawal from the bloc in March.

5e7244f0bf317422754f7e3e	EUR/USD Forex Market Trading Strategies: Understanding The Selloff	The daily chart of the EUR/USD Forex market has been selling off strongly for 2 weeks. However, it is still above the bottom of the 3 week bull trend reversal. Consequently, this selloff is more likely a bear leg in a trading range than a resumption of the 2 year bear trend. With the crashing of the world financial markets over the past few weeks, there has been a flight to safety. The US is typically the least bad country during a crisis and investors tend to shift assets into dollars. The 5 minute chart of the EUR/USD Forex market has been selling off again overnight. But it was been sideways for the past 4 hours. The EUR/USD broke below that range 15 minutes ago. However, a trading range is an area of agreement and a magnet. Therefore, there is at least a 50% chance of a reversal back up into that range this morning. Can the EUR/USD sell off strongly from here today? With two 60 pip rallies overnight, the EURUSD will probably not fall much further today. In fact, a 3rd rally to back above 1.10 is more likely. Will today be a big bull trend day? After falling 130 pips from the overnight high, the best the bulls can probably get today is a reversal back up to the middle of the day’s range.	USD
5e959fe0c46fb854d07210ff	USD/JPY Forecast: Bears retain control, 106.50 at sight	The USD/JPY pair is trading near a fresh weekly low of 107.37, amid persistent dollar’s weakness. The market’s mood improved during Asian trading hours, as the Chinese Trade Balance resulted better than expected, posting a surplus of $19.9B in March. Imports were down by 0.9% while exports decreased by 6.6%, both better than anticipated. Regarding the coronavirus pandemic, the numbers in the most hit European countries continue to improve, although at a painful pace. Most major economies have extended the lock-downs into early May, while slowly re-opening some non-essential business, in an attempt to return to normal in stages. In the US, on the contrary, the pandemic has not yet reached a peak, while President Trump says he wants to restart the economy earlier than recommended. Meanwhile, Japan didn’t release relevant data, and the US calendar has nothing relevant to offer this Tuesday. The USD/JPY pair is technically bearish, unable to advance beyond the 38.2% retracement of its March decline at 107.65, the immediate resistance. The 4-hour chart shows that moving averages gain bearish traction above the current level, and above the mentioned Fibonacci level. Technical indicators remain within negative levels with modest bearish strength, still aiming lower and indicating further declines ahead. Support levels: 107.30 106.95 106.50 Resistance levels: 107.70 108.10 108.50 View Live Chart for the USD/JPY	JPY
5e621d461de645265f6007f1	Euro-dollar volatility surges to 15-month high	(Reuters) - Currency volatility gauges rose on Friday, with one-month euro-dollar implied volatility hitting the highest since November 2018 as coronavirus fears sparked wild swings across global markets. Euro-dollar vol which hit record lows around 3.8% and has been dormant for years, has started moving in recent weeks and traded on Friday at 7.7%. It traded at 6.75% a week ago. Volatlility on equity and bond markets has also risen, with the VIX gauge rising this week to the highest since early-2018. Reporting by Sujata Rao; Editing by Tommy Reggiori Wilkes	USD
5e832805a8dd8e67f42fed22	3 reasons why China won’t ‘weaponize’ its currency as trade-war escalates	Get ready for a further weakness in the Chinese yuan, but look for Beijing to limit the drop even as the U.S.-China trade war intensifies, analysts said after the currency this week fell to an 11 1/2-year low versus the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar hit a high of 7.169 yuan USDCNY, +0.00% on Tuesday, its strongest versus the currency since early 2008. The yuan recently traded at 7.162 per dollar. Downside was kept in check after the People’s Bank of China set the midpoint of its daily trading band at 7.081. That was weaker than the previous fix but stronger than expected, according to Reuters. The yuan has dropped 3.9% in August amid escalating U.S.-China trade policy tensions. In offshore trade, the currency is down around 3.6% over the same period, according to FactSet. See:Why a falling Chinese yuan crushed the stock market and intensified the trade war The fear of a sharp, continued fall in the yuan is one item keeping investors and policy makers awake at night after the yuan’s 2015 devaluation sparked global financial market volatility. While rising U.S. tariffs on imported Chinese goods further muddy China’s economic outlook, and warrant a weaker yuan, Beijing is likely to ensure that the decline is “both controlled and limited,” wrote analysts at UBS, in a Tuesday note. They offered three reasons: Nevertheless, the direction for the yuan is likely to be to the downside barring any significant improvement in U.S. - China trade relations, said analysts who look for the yuan to weaken to 7.4 per dollar over the next three and six months and 7.3 per dollar over the next 12 months. With tensions running high, analysts say they continue to urge investors to hedge yuan long exposure versus the greenback.

5e5eea0b5a592538c8639596	US Dollar Forecast Post-Fed Rate Cut: AUD/USD & USD/CAD Eyed	The US Dollar has crumbled a confounding 2.75% over the last two weeks on balance. A shock 50bps rate cut delivered by the Federal Reserve earlier today overwhelmingly explains the latest drop in the US Dollar. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView USD price action has gravitated lower on the back of recently rekindled recession odds, which stems largely from the novel coronavirus outbreak and its destabilizing impact on global economic activity. Downside in the US Dollar since mid-February has overwhelmingly erased the monumental rally recorded by the broader DXY Index and pushed the benchmark of major currency pairs back toward year-to-date lows. The US Dollar Index is now hovering around a critical level of confluent support underpinned by the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of its most recent bullish leg. If this technical barrier fails to keep USD price action afloat, the US Dollar could continue sliding toward its December 31 swing low. There has been an unprecedented downshift in the futures-implied Federal funds rate (FFR) curve over the last several trading sessions. Trader angst around the coronavirus has prompted market participants to ramp up Fed rate cut expectations, which now stand at a staggering 70-basis points by the December FOMC decision. This is on top of the 0.5% emergency rate cut delivered on Tuesday. As such, the direction of the US Dollar will likely respond predominantly to the convergence between current market expectations and guidance from FOMC officials. The Fed may capitulate as it has over recent history to match futures-implied probabilities of anticipated FOMC rate changes, which could be further encouraged by disappointing economic data expected this week like the ISM Services PMI or nonfarm payrolls (NFPs). That said, AUD/USD price action could be crucial for forex traders to watch considering Australia GDP data is also due for release. Spot AUD/USD briefly pierced the downward-sloping trendline of resistance that connects the series of lower-highs printed throughout the year, but quickly reversed back lower toward its 9-day exponential moving average. AUD/USD overnight implied volatility of 14.3% highlights the potential for outsized moves in spot prices as expected currency volatility continues to creep higher. Judging by its overnight implied volatility reading of 14.3%, spot AUD/USD is estimated to trade between 0.6545-0.6643 with a 68% statistical probability over the next 24-hours. USD/CAD might be gearing up for a topside breakout despite the latest FOMC interest rate cut. Spot USD/CAD price action could eclipse technical resistance presented by the 1.34 handle if the Bank of Canada (BOC) decides to join other dovish central banks slashing their benchmark interest rates. On the other hand, the BOC could reiterate its neutral monetary policy, which might send spot USD/CAD prices spiking lower. The BOC is due to release its upcoming interest rate decision on Wednesday, March 04 at 15:00 GMT. USD/CAD overnight implied volatility of 8.2% is also at extremes seeing that the measurement ranks in the top 99th percentile of readings taken over the last 12-months. Spot USD/CAD is estimated to trade between 1.3325-1.3439 with a 68% statistical probability if implied volatility readings are believed to be true. -- Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight	AUD
5e5d08eebd5d9d5ac07275fc	Nasdaq 100 Forecast: Stocks Plunge on Coronavirus Fears	After stumbling into the weekend, stocks suffered a massive gap lower to start the week with the Nasdaq plummeting more than -4% at the open. Early price moves on the S&P 500 and Dow Jones were even more historic as each posted their largest lower gaps in over 20 years. As we discussed last week, equity price action was becoming increasingly tenuous as gold mounted a bullish breakout higher and risk-sensitive currencies like the Australian Dollar edged lower. Gap measure percent in red, daily rate of change in blue Still, the rally had proved resilient up to this point and further declines were not guaranteed but an uptick in coronavirus fears over the weekend seemingly sparked greater risk aversion and were largely to blame for Monday’s tragic opening. As the outbreak expands into a global issue, its economic impact will extend similarly. To that end, a worrisome uptick in confirmed cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea reveal the alarming ability of the virus to spread. Consequently, global travel is expected to slow, and airline stocks have reacted accordingly. Evidently, the damage is not limited to airline stocks as the tech-heavy Nasdaq led Monday’s declines and earnings expectations have been lowered across the board. With that in mind, it is difficult to ascertain the exact impact of the coronavirus because there are so few precedents and so many unknowns. This creates greater uncertainty for investors – something which most detest – and it could translate to prolonged volatility for the stock market in the days and weeks to come. Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, DAX 30, Nikkei 225 Forecasts for the Week Ahead Either way, it seems the driving force behind both price action and sentiment is the virus, so further updates could prove crucial for the Nasdaq as it looks to hold above subsequent support. Similarly, various central bank officials from across the globe have begun to express potential monetary policy initiatives to combat the economic effects of the virus.

5e6ae8b5b4c75716317f2741	Dollar surges vs yen as stock markets rally	The dollar surged on Friday, posting sharp gains against the safe-haven Japanese yen as stock markets recovered globally and investors cheered efforts by governments and policymakers to address the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. The greenback extended gains against several currencies after a blowout in swap spreads on Thursday signaled that investors want dollars. While those spreads came in on Friday, the dollar held strong. The dollar also benefited from a news report that U.S. President Donald Trump will declare a national emergency over the fast-spreading coronavirus on Friday, opening the door to more federal aid to combat the disease. But market participants said signs of dollar funding stress persist and policymakers probably need to do more. “Underlying concerns regarding the economic fallout from the coronavirus on credit markets broadly remain,” said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, at Scotiabank in Toronto. “It may be tempting to look for signs of a low in global stocks but with the underlying issue - the coronavirus - still unchecked, we think that is premature at this point,” he added. He noted that the cost of raising U.S. dollar funds in the cross-currency euro swap market has widened again on Friday after narrowing the day before on the Federal Reserve’s announcement to inject more liquidity into the banking system. Wider spreads in the cross currency basis swap market suggested increased signs of U.S. dollar shortage for corporates seeking funding. In afternoon trading, the dollar gained 2.9% against the yen to 107.66 Wells Fargo said it had further upgraded its forecast for the yen against the dollar as the risk of financial turmoil remains, saying that the greenback will fall below 100 yen. “The rate cuts and other policy actions from global central banks have done little to quell market panic. That may be due to the fact that fiscal policymakers have generally been slow to act,” said Wells Fargo in a research note. The dollar also rallied versus another safe haven, the Swiss franc, rising 1.1% to 0.9543 franc. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar rose 1.2% to 98.362 The euro nursed losses despite European Central Bank policymakers’ efforts to reassure markets. European assets sold off on Thursday after investors were underwhelmed by the bank’s stimulus measures. The euro was last down 0.9% at $1.1091 . The ECB on Thursday announced a stimulus package that provides loans to banks with rates as low as -0.75% and increases bond purchases, but it did not join its counterparts in the United States and Britain by cutting rates. The pound also plunged 2% against the dollar to $1.2302. The greenback’s rebound this week reflects its role as the world’s most liquid currency, which investors seek in times of stress. The Fed meets next week and many analysts now expect the central bank to chop its own target policy rate, quite possibly to zero, and give markets new guidance about how it plans to combat the economic fallout from the coronavirus.

5e7e4f011df9bc4989b6c0df	GBP/USD Reverses On Stopping Volume	A solid reversal on cable on the 3-minute chart signalled as always with volume, and one which also introduces another plan of the volume price analysis methodology which is support and resistance. First, we saw the breakaway from the volume point of control (yellow dashed line) but note the volume, which is falling and sign the move lacks strength. Then, we see the stopping volume on the narrow spread candle, and this is followed by the strong reversal candle on high volume. The rally then develops breaking two levels of resistance denoted with the red dashed lines of the accumulation and distribution indicator, and punctuated with weak selling pressure. The weakness of the move lower indicates the bullish momentum is set to continue with the trend monitor below also confirming this sentiment.	GBP
5e95cc653b50f73b667c99af	XAU/USD outlook: Gold advanced 6% in three days, proving its strong safe-haven appeal	Spot gold advanced to new highest level since November 2012 on Tuesday, gaining 1.7% since opening that adds to 4.2% rally in past two days. Strong concerns over expected slowdown of global economic growth on pandemic lockdown and stimulus measures from central banks and governments in attempt to cushion negative impact, boosted yellow metal's safe-haven appeal. Today's fresh bullish extension is on track for clear close above important Fibo barrier at $1714 (76.4% of $1920/$1046), following Monday's marginal close above, would generate bullish signal for extension towards psychological $1800 barrier ($1795 is 2012 high). Bullish daily studies support the advance, with price action so far ignoring overbought conditions (stochastic) and evident loss of bullish momentum, which give initial signal that bulls would enter consolidation in coming sessions. Dip-buying remains favored while dips hold above broken strong barriers at $1700 zone, now reverted to supports. Res: 1750; 1762; 1795; 1800 Sup: 1721; 1712; 1703; 1686	METAL
5e5d08d3bd5d9d5ac07275da	USD/MXN - Mexican Peso at Risk vs US Dollar, Peso Bulls Near Record	USD/MXN Analysis and Talking Points Until the backend of last week, the Mexican Peso had seemed somewhat insulated from the growing fears regarding the coronavirus. However, as the spread of the virus continues with reports now suggesting that it has reached Latin America (coronavirus case in Brazil), risks are growing to the downside for the Peso as safe-haven flows are likely to boost USD/MXN, particularly with the fall out in global equities weighing on the EM complex. On the domestic front, yesterday’s Q4 GDP data, which showed a contraction of 0.5%, confirmed the extension of Mexico’s mild recession. In turn, with the coronavirus also expected to weigh on activity growth, Banxico may be forced to continue easing monetary policy and thus keep MXN under pressure. It is also prudent to be cognizant of the fact that investors are notably bullish on the Mexican Peso with both non-commercials and asset managers holding near record number of net long positions. As such, the risks are asymmetrically tilted to the downside for the Peso, which remains vulnerable to liquidating longs as contagion of coronavirus threatens emerging markets. The recent upside in USD/MXN has been curbed by the 200DMA (19.21), which also marks today’s high. However, given the deterioration in risk sentiment USD/MXN remains tilted to the upside where a break above the 200DMA could see an extension towards 19.60. On the downside, it would take a close below 19.80 (100DMA) to resume the bear trend. Source: IG Charts --- Written by Justin McQueen, Market Analyst Follow Justin on Twitter @JMcQueenFX	MXN
5e85d5870fdd7234dc38c27f	Bear-market survival tips from an analyst who spent years warning of a bubble	Our call of the day comes from Jesse Colombo, an independent economic analyst who predicted the 2008 crash, and has been warning of an “everything bubble” for years as underlying issues from that crisis were never fixed. Read his recession prediction last summer, here. Colombo says the virus is the pin that just happened to prick the bubble, and as a “prepper,” he has tucked away a year’s worth of food as he foresees social unrest and economic strife ahead. As for markets, he tells MarketWatch the selloff for equities and many other assets will continue until speculative excesses get corrected first. He’s not buying stocks bonds, or any paper assets “inflated” by central banks, or residential or commercial real estate. “What I believe in this point is hard assets and alternative assets…physical gold, physical silver, some bitcoin and then some survival-type investments…homestead out the country, ranch, farmland,” he says. As for those excesses, he refers to a chat he had with MarketWatch in 2018 when he warned that household wealth had been dangerously outpacing the economic expansion. At the time of the article, household wealth as a share of nominal gross domestic product was at 505%, vs. 473% in the housing bubble peak, 429% in the dot-com bust and an average of 371% since 1951. He says the latest data shows that ratio reached 545% in the fourth quarter of 2019. “We could very well erase this entire rally in household wealth and my whole point is that…a 3-week correction is not enough to erase 11 years of asset price inflation,” he says. He points to another chart showing overvalued assets — the ratio of the total market capitalization of all U.S. stocks to GDP, a favorite of Berkshire Hathaway’s BRK.A, +1.22% BRK.B, +1.48% Chairman Warren Buffett. He says it isn’t impossible we’d drop back to 1980 levels and then some. “When a secular bear market occurs, prices won’t just go down to historic averages and stop. A lot of times they overshoot.” When do the lockdowns end? Deutsche Bank’s chart takes a stab at it. Analysts note their forecasts depends on how the epidemic curve progresses in each country. Spoiler alert — hay fever might all but disappear. Here’s what might survive 2020, but be far less popular. Teaching his dog to drive lands man in jail.

5e95735b3a94556e8b6fffed	USD/SGD could see buyers appearing soon	In this blog, we are going to take a look at the Elliott Wave chart of USDSGD. The 4 hour chart update from April 13, 2020 shows that 5 waves impulsive structure has ended on March 23, 2020. The rally ended at 1.4646 high. Based on Elliott Wave theory, a 3 waves pullback should happen before the rally to the upside can resume again. The cycle from March 23, 2020 high is unfolding as double three correction. The pair has broken below wave (W) low to confirm that the next leg lower has started. Wave (W) ended at 1.4198 low. Meanwhile, the bounce in wave (X) ended at 1.4416 high. From there, the pair has resumed lower. The 100% extension of wave (W)-(X) where wave (Y) can potentially end is at 1.3693-1.3970 area. This area is shown with a blue box on the chart. As long as 1.618 extension at 1.3693 stays intact, buyers should start to appear at the blue box area. From there, the pair can see 3 waves bounce at least or an extension higher. Near term, 1 hour chart from April 13, 2020 New York update shows that the pair has ended wave W at 1.4105 low. Right now, the pair is doing a bounce in wave X. While below 1.4418 high, expect the bounce in 3,7, or 11 swing to fail. Afterwards, the pair may continue to extend lower towards the equal leg blue box area shown in the previous 4 hour chart update.	SGD
5e95f414b71fb70b58a84197	It's Make It Or Break It For Australian Dollar	China reported a trade surplus for March earlier today at +19.90 billion versus -7.09 billion for the combined January-February period. China seems to be back in business after being shut down completely for two months. Additional data will be released later in the week. However, all eyes will now focus on if they can keep the coronavirus at bay, as a few flare ups have developed in a few areas. Australia relies heavily on China as a trading partner. As such, as the economy of China goes, so does the economy of Australia. Traders have been anticipating China’s improved data for the last month as China began reopening its factories and the economy. As a result, the Australian dollar has been moving higher as well. But now, pairs such as AUD/USD and AUD/JPY are at a point where they need to break though significant resistance to reach their previous February levels, or they will roll over and head lower. On a 240-minute AUD/USD chart, the pair has broken out of a pennant formation, with a target near the March 9 highs and previous support (now acting as resistance) at February’s lows. However, price has stalled (at the less often looked) at 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the March 9 highs to the March 18 lows at .6433. In addition, this level happens to be horizontal resistance. The RSI is also in overbought conditions, however, still pointing higher. If AUD/USD can break through .6450, price could run back up to prior highs near .6675. If price fails from here, support is back at the 61.8% retracement level near .6234/.6250. On a 240-minute AUD/JPY chart, there is a similar pattern that has set up. Here, price has traded into the gap from March 9 and is up against horizontal resistance at 69.40. In addition, price has stalled at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from the Feb. 20 highs to the March 18 lows. However, price has not yet filled the gap and is trading in an ascending wedge formation. If AUD/JPY can break higher and fill the gap near 69.75, price should be able to run up to horizontal resistance near 71.50 and then a full retracement up to 74.50. If price fails and breaks lower out of the ascending wedge, the target would be a long way down, back to 60.00. There will be a great deal of support along the way though, such as the upward sloping trendline and horizontal support convergence near 67.70 and horizontal support near 65.60. The U.S. is also discussing reopening the economy. If that happens “sooner than later,” equities should also continue to climb, and bring AUD/USD with it. Watch both China and the U.S. for new information regarding the coronavirus to help determine the next direction if the Australian dollar!	AUD
5e5d361ff684d01f2eef1778	Canadian Dollar Price Outlook: USD/CAD Initializes Bullish Break Out	USD/CAD rallied above resistance last week as risk aversion ran rampant and stocks were battered beneath support on fears the coronavirus will hamstring the global economy. In turn, crude oil entered deeper into a bear market as the demand outlook for the commodity was reassessed. Together, the two developments – risk aversion and weaker global growth expectations – likely played major roles in the USD/CAD break out. With technical resistance at 1.3345 pierced as a result, the pair can look to continue higher after months of consolidation. Further, near-term retracements will have to negotiate prior topside barriers as they turn to support. With that in mind, it seems as though USD/CAD is poised to continue higher and target possible resistance around 1.3446 and 1.3500 if it can successfully hold above 1.3345 in the days ahead. While there are bullish cases to be made, a continuation higher is far from certain and is unlikely to occur in a single move. A long upper wick on Friday’s daily candle hints at waning bullish interest and the pair has already probed support early in Monday trading. Consequently, a break beneath 1.3345 may see USD/CAD request further assistance at the ascending trendline and 200-day simple moving average around 1.3200 in the days to come. Still, IG Client Sentiment Data suggests the pair may continue higher in the weeks ahead.

5e8c50d5315b35404284f20f	Dollar falls, riskier currencies rally on virus lockdown hopes	LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar lost ground on Tuesday as riskier currencies rebounded on tentative hopes that lockdowns may be slowing the spread of the coronavirus in some countries. Bets that the world’s biggest crude producers may cut supply to support oil prices also boosted market sentiment. The greenback - the world’s reserve currency - has swung wildly in recent weeks in volatile trading. But action by central banks to ease a mad scramble for dollars has helped bring some calm to markets. The dollar was last down 0.6% versus a basket of currencies =USD, mirroring improved risk sentiment across equity markets, with European shares up for a second straight day. Sterling also rallied, even as traders awaited news on the health condition of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is fighting worsening coronavirus symptoms in intensive care. Analysts said that while news of Johnson's condition was clearly a concern, beyond a dip in Asian hours it had not yet moved the pound as it was unlikely to mean a change in the government's policy direction to fight the virus. Sterling was last up 0.7%. GBP=D3 The dollar was down 0.3% against the yen as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a state of emergency for parts of the country on Tuesday to counter the spread of coronavirus. JPY=EBS The euro rose 0.7%, last trading at $1.08650. EUR=EBS “We’ve got a nice decline in volatility across forex and equity markets. We know central banks have done a very good job in alleviating the strain in dollar markets and that’s feeding through,” said Kenneth Broux, FX strategist at Societe Generale. “We need some time for this to settle... I think what we are seeing is a bit of reversion - a correction from exaggerating selling. We are in that process.” Dollar borrowing costs in swap markets have retreated, with swap rates against the euro and pound falling to their lowest levels in more than a decade this week. Oil also rose on Tuesday amid hope that oil producers will agree to cut output in the face of crushed demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. Commodities-exposed currencies including the Norwegian crown, Australian dollar and South African rand rallied particularly strongly, all up more than 1% on the day. NOK= AUD=D3 ZAR= Those currencies were battered last month when investors dumped them for the safety of the U.S. dollar. The Reserve Bank of Australia kept policy on hold at a meeting overnight after it already slashed interest rates and embarked on quantitative easing. “With evidence continuing to build that the lockdowns are proving effective at slowing the spread of COVID-19, market participants’ focus is beginning to shift to when and how the lockdowns could be eased,” analysts at MUFG said in a note.

5e7bfbef5fe8e204c12473be	Dollar drops as US jobless claims surge	"The dollar dropped to a one-week low against a basket of currencies on Thursday after data showed an unprecedented surge in Americans filing for unemployment benefits, as businesses across the country shut down in an attempt to stem the spread of the coronavirus. The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits shot to record of more than 3 million last week. The jobless blowout was announced shortly after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the U.S. economy ""may well be in recession"" but progress in controlling the spread of the coronavirus will dictate when the economy can fully reopen. His remarks were an unusual acknowledgement by a Fed chair that the economy may be contracting even before data confirms it. ""The number has sent chills through the markets. If these numbers continue for three or four weeks, there will be demand for more fiscal support,"" and even more monetary support from the Fed, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. The dollar index fell 1.5% to 99.57, the lowest since March 18. The euro gained to $1.0972, up 0.85% on the day and the highest since March 18. The greenback dipped 1.53% against the Japanese yen to 109.49 yen. The Australian dollar jumped 1.31% to $0.6036. The U.S. Senate on Wednesday unanimously backed a $2 trillion bill aimed at helping unemployed workers and industries hurt by the coronavirus epidemic, as well as providing billions of dollars to buy urgently needed medical equipment. The Federal Reserve last week launched new bond purchase and lending programs in an attempt to ease market logjams. It also committed to swapping dollars for foreign currencies with other major central banks after a desperate scramble for the currency last week sent the dollar to three year highs against the euro, 35-year highs against sterling and 17-year highs against the Australian dollar. ""Although the latest Fed measures have helped calm markets, as long as the Covid-19 crisis continues and the world economy is effectively in lockdown, we would expect markets to remain in turmoil,"" foreign exchange analysts at Bank of America said in a report on Thursday."

5e86fa88c5e38a4cf4146bd2	He nailed the March coronavirus selloff — now he says there’s another 30% to go before the stock market hits bottom	Hedge-fund manager Dan Niles, in a note cited by Yahoo Finance this week, warned his clients way back in February that he was getting “increasingly worried” investors weren’t ready for the impact the spread of the coronavirus could have on the U.S. economy. So Niles positioned his portfolio accordingly. Good thing. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.68% posted its worst first quarter ever, his Satori Fund closed in positive territory. But, more importantly, where do stock markets go from? Definitely not higher, if Niles has it right. “If you go back and look at history, there are nine times that the market has sold off about 30% or so since the 1920s, so it’s pretty normal,” he said this week. “You get one of these every 10 years or so and if you look at every one of them, you always get these bear market rallies.” Dispatches from a pandemic:I went to the grocery store in a balaclava — turns out, De Blasio now says ALL New Yorkers should wear improvised face masks Niles told Yahoo Finance that he sees another major drop from here, pointing to valuations that are still hovering well above historical norms, even after the painful pullback. “Just to get to average, you would have to have the market go down 30%,” he said. “It is very easy to figure out the market probably goes down 30% before we’re even near fair valuation.” So, no bottom yet? “I sort of laugh when I hear people talking about a V-shaped recovery because we are going to have at least 10% unemployment, my guess is closer to 20% before all of this is said and done,” Niles said. “You are not going to get a fast recovery with that many people out of a job and we’re not just talking in the United States. We are talking all across the globe there are problems that are happening.” Niles explained that he’s still adding to his short positions, but he’s also going long in areas he believes to be resistant to the next batch of selling. He said he’s adding to his stakes in Activision ATVI, -1.31%, Take-Two Interactive TTWO, -0.85% and Amazon AMZN, -0.63%. Check out the full interview: The bulls had the upper hand in Thursday’s session, with the Dow, S&P SPX, -1.51% and tech-heavy Nasdaq COMP, -1.52% all gaining ground in afternoon trades.

5e9561cc300c27142750aa31	Inflation in CEE	Regional currencies got a boost from the positive international sentiment and mostly gained in the last week before the holidays. The HUF firmed the most after the central bank tightened monetary conditions further. The CZK gained almost as much as the forint. On the other hand, the Polish zloty gained much less, as the government announced another round of sizable economic stimulus, coupled with another rate cut that came earlier than assumed. The change in the international sentiment was abruptly positive, likely due to more positive news around the coronavirus. However, this rapid change in sentiment warrants some caution about upcoming currency market developments in CEE. Despite the increase in German Bund yields last week, CEE yields were more mixed. In Slovenia and Slovakia, yields increased. That said, Slovakia advanced a lot in covering increased financing needs by selling EUR 1.5bn in T-bills and another EUR 1.5bn in 2030 bonds. Czechs have also pushed issuance further, which could have contributed to higher bond yields there. Yields fell in Hungary and in Poland, however. In Hungary, the MNB flagged that it could launch QE, while in Poland, the new round of the fiscal package could be helped by increased liquidity provision and additional bond purchases by the NBP.

5e5d08bebd5d9d5ac07275ce	Euro May Fall on Eurozone Confidence Data as COVID-19 Spreads	APAC equities continued to experience market-wide pandemonium as fear about the coronavirus continued to undermine bullish sentiment. This followed another bloody day on Wall Street after the S&P 500 suffered another aggressive selloff and declined almost one percent as it trades at three-month lows. This came as spreads on credit default swaps for sub-investment grade corporate debt in Europe surged to six-month highs. At the start of Asia’s Thursday trading session, US President Donald Trump held a press conference about the coronavirus but failed to calm market angst. The Commander in Chief announced VP Mike Pence would be taking charge of handling COVID-19 and announced that he is considering cutting off other countries from entering the US. The economic ramifications of such a policy could further derail the global recovery. Eurozone economic confidence data for February is expected to remain unchanged at 102.8 with its industrial equivalent anticipated to show a -7.2 reading. However, the growing number of confirmed coronavirus cases across Europe may have infected the outlook of participants taking part in the survey. Consequently, these statistics may underwhelm and further dampen the outlook for Eurozone growth. This comes as the region was beginning to show signs of stabilization before the growth-disrupting effects of COVID-19 began to impact economic activity. Italy, the third largest Eurozone economy has reported over 340 cases of the virus with Germany’s health minister warned that the proverbial steam engine of Europe is at the beginning of an epidemic. The Euro 5Y5Y inflation swap forward – a favored price growth indicator of the ECB’s – is less than one third of a percent away from its all-time low at 1.1688. This suggests that market participants believe regional inflationary prospects are now even more likely to remain subdued in light of COVID-19. This may in turn make it more difficult for the ECB to remain neutral and may inflame expectations that they will step in. EUR/CHF has been trading without direction after it touched a five-year low amid a market-wide selloff in the Euro as risk aversion prompted regional traders to buy up the anti-risk Swiss Franc. The pair is now trading in a narrowing range between descending resistance and support at 1.0610 with growing pressure on whether an upside or downside breakout out is in the cards. The fundamental context supports a bearish bias.

5e623260cfb96a0d7af91932	Euro and yen surge as Treasury yield collapse whacks dollar	LONDON (Reuters) - The euro roared past $1.13 on Friday and the yen pushed below the 105 level, as a dramatic collapse in U.S. government bond yields sent the dollar on course for its worst week since 2016. Investors have slashed their expectations for U.S. interest rates following an emergency Federal Reserve 50 basis point cut this week. That is wiping away the yield advantage that had fuelled one of the popular carry trades globally - borrowing at negative rates in the euro and yen to buy U.S. assets. Markets now bet the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates by 50 basis points for a second time this month. The greenback index is set for its biggest weekly fall since May 2016, down more than 2% since Monday. “The driver is the equity markets and the collapse in U.S. bond yields this week,” said Kenneth Broux, FX strategist at Societe Generale. “It’s been a knee-jerk reaction. What we have now is a reversal simply on the declining U.S. equities and the compressing differential. “The reality is the Fed has taken on more insurance ... No-one knows how long this (the coronavirus outbreak) will last but taking a step back I would expect the dollar to bounce.” Choppy global markets led currency volatility gauges to rise on Friday, with one-month euro-dollar implied volatility hitting the highest since November 2018. ING analysts said they were targeting $1.15 per euro in the coming weeks as aggressive U.S. rate cuts contrasted with the limited room for action at the European Central Bank. Fed fund futures <0#FF:> were pricing in about 90 basis points of further easing by the end of the year. “For now, expect USD weakness vs G10 FX to continue, and the G10 FX segment outperforming EM FX, with carry trades under pressure,” they said in a research note. The euro gained 0.7% to as high as $1.1324, its strongest since July. The single currency was stuck below $1.08 last month. Euro vs U.S. dollar: here The dollar index skidded 0.7% to 95.892, its weakest since July. Against the yen, the dollar dropped more than 1% and below 105 yen. The yen is benefiting both from dollar weakness and its reputation as a safe haven. The dollar was not weaker everywhere, however. It still holds safe-haven status compared with emerging-market currencies, those exposed to commodities such as the Canadian and Australian and New Zealand dollars and versus Asian currencies, where the coronavirus economic effect is pronounced. Sterling seized on the dollar’s spiral downwards, hitting $1.3015 before settling at $1.2987. Editing by Larry King, Robert Birsel	USD
5e5d0920bd5d9d5ac072764f	Cryptocurrency Latest: Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP) Weekend Price Slump	A Guide to Day Trading Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies Weekend trading in the cryptocurrency space has seen sharp moves before, and this weekend was no different with a sharp sell-off across the board wiping out last week’s rally. According to market reports, one seller slammed Bitcoin lower on Saturday, taking the rest of the market lower in its wake. Prices via CoinMarketCap.com Despite the weekend sell-off, cryptocurrencies across the board are still sharply higher off the multi-month lows made in mid-December. Looking at Bitcoin, the daily chart remains positive with a series of higher highs and higher lows made since the end of last year. Bitcoin also broke above a longer-dated lower high made on October 28 last year, although this level is now being tested. The moving averages also throw a positive shadow on the chart with the 50-dma (blue) looking to break above the 200-dma (black), a bullish formation known as a ‘golden cross’. If Bitcoin can consolidate above the $9,500 level in the short-term, the market may look to press higher. Ripple, the third-largest crypto by market capitalization, has shed nearly 20% over the last three days as prior enthusiasm for the token evaporated. According to IG Client Sentiment, 97% of customers are net-long XRP, an extreme position. The chart shows that the recent rally broke the longer-term trend of lower-highs and, as with Bitcoin, if the price can consolidate around current levels, then the recent bullish momentum will remain intact. The 50-dma/200-dma crossover is also close and mat give Ripple a boost if/when it takes place.

5e908588a35feb14303e1603	OIL MARKET WEEK AHEAD: The ball is in non-OPEC producers’ courts	While parts of Europe are tentatively dipping their toes into a lighter form of a lockdown, with Austria planing to reopen businesses from next week and Denmark restarting schools, the pandemic is claiming a much higher toll in the US. Given that the US is a little bit behind Europe on the virus spread curve, next week’s US oil and economic data will carry more weight than usual as it will very quickly provide an insight in how badly the ravaging of the coronavirus is affecting the domestic oil market. OPEC+: What next? Saudi Arabia and Russia have temporarily buried their hatchets, under duress, and together with other OPEC members agreed to cut production by 10m/bbl a day. Though the decision has been a long time coming, the size of the cut will only make a dent in the declining oil price given that global demand has dropped by more than 30% since the start of the pandemic. Some smaller European countries are talking about a slight easing of lockdown rules but to put it into perspective, they have already said that they will keep their borders closed and not allow international travel and holidays until there is a vaccine. This means that the two main strands of oil demand, demand from cars/buses and jet fuel demand for the airlines, are unlikely to seriously tick up before the autumn. Now that OPEC and Russia have made their move, the rest of the support for the oil industry will have to come from elsewhere. At today’s G20 meeting, it is possible that the other countries will be asked to either commit to lower production or to buy more oil for their strategic reserves to take some of the surplus out of the market. The ball will be mainly in the courts of the largest producers, including Canada, Mexico, Brazil and the US. EIA status report, rig count and jobless data Possibly the scariest US data at present, apart from the number of infected people, is the galloping increase in initial jobless numbers. On current count the last three weeks have brought 3.3m new jobless, then 6.8m and this week another 6.6m new job seekers. Until the tide of job losses begins to turn there is no chance of the oil market changing trend either, other than on a very temporary basis, as the fundamental underlying domestic demand continues to be far less than pre-crisis levels. The Energy Information Administration’s report on Wednesday is likely to show a further decline in oil production and deeper destruction of domestic US demand. Refinery utilisation rates have already dropped to 75.6%, down from 82.9% earlier this month and US crude oil refinery inputs thinned out by 1.3m bbl per day to average 13.6m bbl per day. The number of rigs operating in the US has declined by almost 10% to 664, a loss of 361 rigs compared to the rig count a year ago. In the week ahead, look out for further news from producers, be it about abandoning future projects, shuttering parts of production or cutting jobs.

5e62a8f0daad8d46b8f89feb	EUR/USD: What's Happening?	Increased fears of a coronavirus pandemic plummeted global stocks at the start of today's European session. The DXY dollar index fell below 96.00, and the yield on 10-year US bonds fell by almost 18%, to 0.723%, to historical lows. The growth of almost panic investor sentiment was facilitated by information on the penetration of coronavirus into the United States. EUR / USD updated the highs of July 2019, breaking through the psychologically significant resistance level of 1.1300, and reached the first critical resistance level of 1.1340 at the beginning of today's European session (EMA144 on the weekly chart). If the growth of EUR/USD does not stop, then the pair can reach the key resistance level of 1.1440 (EMA200 on the weekly chart), the breakdown of which can signal the breaking of the long-term bearish trend of EUR / USD. Last Tuesday, the Fed unexpectedly lowered the interest rate by 0.50%, substantiating its decision with the need for preventive measures to maintain the American economy, which, according to Fed leaders, remains strong. The next Fed meeting will be held on March 18, and it is possible that the rate will be reduced again. By the way, US President Donald Trump after the Fed lowered the rate on Tuesday again called on the Fed to lower the interest rate even lower, down to 0%. “They (the Fed) are acting belatedly”, Trump said, but should, in his opinion, act ahead of events. Today, volatility in the financial markets may rise again at 13:30 (GMT), when data from the US labor market will be published. Strong data expected. Nevertheless, even if the data are confirmed or turn out to be better than expected (NFP is expected to grow by 175,000 new jobs), one should not expect a significant strengthening of the dollar and a fall in EUR / USD. The fall of European stock indices leaves the euro, which is the funding currency, no chance of weakening. In the current situation of growth of already almost panic moods, it makes no sense to expect a quick recovery of world stock indices. Technical analysis fades into the background. And, nevertheless, you can’t completely forget about the alternative scenario. The first signal to start the correctional decline will be the breakdown of support levels 1.1285 (Fibonacci level 23.6% of upward correction to the fall of the pair from 1.3870 in May 2014 to 1.0480 reached in March 2015), 1.1240 (ЕМА200 on the 5-minute price chart and highs of December 2019). However, only the return of EUR / USD to the zone below the key support level of 1.1100 (EMA200 on the daily chart) will reassure investors and create the prerequisites for the pair to sell. Support Levels: 1.1300, 1.1285, 1.1240, 1.1205, 1.1100 Resistance Levels: 1.1340, 1.1400, 1.1440 Trading Recommendations Sell ​​Stop 1.1275. Stop-Loss 1.1330. Take-Profit 1.1240, 1.1205, 1.1100 Buy Stop 1.1330. Stop-Loss 1.1275. Take-Profit 1.1340, 1.1400, 1.1440	USD
5e844130cc4ca9026a9271d1	Dollar rallies as investors brace for global downturn	TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar was a touch firmer on Wednesday, buoyed by its safe-haven status with the world staring at what is likely to be one of the worst economic contractions for decades as it locks down to fight the coronavirus pandemic. It advanced against the Australian and New Zealand dollars, the euro, yen, Swiss franc and pound in Asian trade - but not much - as appetite for the safety of cash dollars was offset by aggressive liquidity measures from the U.S. Federal Reserve. The Australian dollar dipped 0.2% to $0.6123 and the New Zealand dollar dropped 0.3% to $0.5945. The euro eased 0.3% to $1.1010 and the dollar rose 0.2% to 107.74 Japanese yen. However that still left the dollar beneath overnight highs against most majors and well below multi-year peaks made last month, before the Fed’s pumped more dollars into the system to calm markets. The Fed on Tuesday broadened the ability of dozens of foreign central banks to access dollars during the coronavirus crisis by allowing them to exchange their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities for overnight dollar loans. “The whole experience is testing the maxim in the market of ‘don’t fight the Fed,’” said Kyle Rodda, analyst at broker IG Markets in Melbourne. “The Fed clearly wants to do everything it can necessary to ensure dollar liquidity, which puts downward pressure on the dollar,” he said. “But by the same token there is still this very structural push to buy dollars right now because liquidity is coming at an absolute premium with so much risk in the market.” The dollar was marginally higher against emerging market currencies and steady at 7.0810 Chinese yuan. Against the pound the dollar firmed 0.3% to $1.2381 per pound. Against a basket of currencies it was flat at 99.028. Meanwhile, manufacturing data in Asia painted a bleak picture. Factory activity in Japan and South Korea posted the biggest contractions in about a decade. The Bank of Japan’s “tankan” corporate survey showed Japanese manufacturers turned pessimistic for the first time in seven years. Surveys due later on Wednesday from countries including Germany and the United States are expected to do similarly little for investor confidence, while U.S. private employment data is likely to show a drop in payrolls. The virus has now killed more than 42,000 people and infected more than 851,000 in 205 countries. Goldman Sachs on Tuesday said it now forecasts a real GDP sequential decline of 34% in the United States this quarter, on an annualised basis, compared with an earlier estimate of a 24% drop. “In the absence of either a material improvement in global risk sentiment, or commodity prices, then together with ongoing dollar strength, we are not convinced the Australian dollar can easily maintain its foothold back above $0.60,” National Australia Bank analysts said in a note.

5e878ae178f3271784de3c25	ETFs to Suffer as March's ISM Manufacturing Index Disappoints	The impact of the coronavirus pandemic can be seen in the manufacturing sector that makes around 11% of the U.S. economy. Accordingly, the latest report on U.S. manufacturing, released by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), failed to cheer investors. The ISM’s national factory activity index came in at 49.1 in March comparing unfavorably with 50.1 in February. It, however, came in better than analysts’ expectations of the reading of 45.0, per a Reuters’ poll. Notably, readings below 50% indicate contraction. The new orders sub-index declined to 42.2 (the lowest since March 2009) from 49.8 in February. Moreover, there was a decline from 46.9 to 43.8 in the measure of factory employment. Manufacturers also informed about paying less for raw materials and other inputs. Timothy Fiore, chair of the Institute for Supply Management, said that “the coronavirus pandemic and shocks in global energy markets have impacted all manufacturing sectors” (read: Play These ETF Strategies as Dow Posts Worst Q1 on Record). The Dow Jones Industrial Average witnessed its worst quarterly performance since 1987, largely due to the coronavirus-led sell-offs. The blue-chip index lost more than 23% of its value in first-quarter 2020, as the pandemic tightened its grip on countries outside mainland China. Seeing the biggest quarterly loss since 2008, the S&P 500 also depreciated 20% in the worst first quarter, followed by a 14% decline of the Nasdaq Composite. Coronavirus & the U.S. Economy The United States has recorded more than 216,500 cases, with a death toll of more than 5,100. The top U.S. government scientists have estimated that even if the current social-distancing guidelines are maintained, the country will likely see around 100,000-240,000 deaths due to the coronavirus pandemic. To combat this, President Trump extended the federal government’s guidelines for social distancing until Apr 30. The outbreak has disrupted global supply chains and economic activities. Manufacturers are struggling with distorted supply chains and logistics, especially those belonging to industries like computers and electronics, fabricated metal and chemical. The job market is also likely to be severely hit as Americans are increasingly filing claims for unemployment benefits. Per the report released by the Labor Department on Mar 26, U.S. unemployment claims surged to a record 3.28 million last week (ending Mar 20). The number surpassed the count of 695,000 that was recorded during the financial crisis. With elevated unemployment levels, the spending capacity of consumers will, undoubtedly, be compromised to a large extent. The latest reports on U.S. consumer sentiment show that the metric dropped to nearly a three-and-a-half-year low in March, reflecting the impact of the coronavirus outbreak (read: ETFs at Risk as US Consumer Sentiment Hits Near 3.5-Year Low).

5e9575ae9cbc8c7a49160007	AUD/USD Outlook: Bulls extend to new one-month high after solid China's data boosted risk appetite	The Australian dollar was a top winner of the Asian session on Tuesday, as bulls extend into seventh straight day and hit new one month high at 0.6432. The Aussie was lifted by fresh risk appetite, sparked by better than expected China's trade data (exports and imports results for March were well above forecasts while trade surplus widened) signaling that Chinese economy is restarting after being slowed by COVID19 pandemic. Solid Chinese data offset very negative Australian NAB business confidence which fell to -66 in March from -4 previous month. Weaker US dollar and firm stocks also contributed to Aussie's advance. Fresh bulls cracked important barrier at 0.6407 (Fibo 76.4% of 0.6684/0.5509/55DMA) and turn focus towards the base of falling daily cloud (0.6517). Strong bullish momentum on daily chart supports scenario, however, overbought stochastic warns that bulls may take a breather before resuming. Expect dips to offer better opportunities to re-enter bullish market, with strong supports at 0.6235 (broken Fibo 61.8%) and 0.6207 (rising 10DMA) expected to contain extended downticks and maintain bullish bias.

5e5d086673d82f5acc8afc5e	US virus case rattles markets	European markets are set for another day of losses after the first case of the coronavirus was reported in the US. A news conference by President Trump late yesterday did little to assuage investors’ nerves; instead US stock futures are dropping this morning, pointing to a lower open on Wall Street later in the day. Yesterday was the first day that the number of new cases outside of China exceeded those in China adding fuel to concerns about the effect of the virus on other economies. In London the most exposed stocks remain airlines, holiday companies, miners and oil producers. However, topping the lineup of FTSE losers is WPP which shed 15.6% after it reported a slowdown in revenue in the last quarter of 2019. The world’s largest advertising company also warned that it did not expect 2020 to provide better results after it lost some of its major clients. Providing some counterbalance to the sliding index were Hikma Pharmaceutical and British American Tobacco, both reporting increases in revenues. BAT surprised investors with better-than-expected full-year profit generated from traditional tobacco sales and higher pricing. Hikma also threw in a generous dividend increase following a 10% increase in operating profit. Brent crude continues to drop Brent crude has been further eroded by the spread of the coronavirus and has slipped briefly below $52 overnight. It is currently bouncing in a channel between $52.6 and $52.84 with little to prop it up in terms of fundamental news. The OPEC Vienna meeting may offer some respite towards the end of next week but before then the pandemic is likely to push prices even lower.	USD
5e659c4566b0cd6d157098c3	Yen, Euro and Franc Climb on Crude Oil Price Crash, China Data	The Japanese Yen outperformed while financial markets swooned as crude oil prices crashed after OPEC and Russia failed to reach a deal prolonging their output cap scheme. The cartel and a group of like-minded producers – dubbed “OPEC+” – have been coordinating to hold back capacity, restrict supply and boost prices since 2016. Riyadh wanted to keep going as the coronavirus threatens demand. Moscow did not. Abysmal trade data from China has compounded the dour mood. The world’s second-largest economy posted the largest trade deficit in 16 years in February. Exports fell 17.2 percent on-year, marking the biggest drop in four years. The decline in imports was more modest at 4 percent. Nevertheless, this marked the 14th consecutive month of contraction, which bodes ill for countries reliant on Chinese demand. Currencies attached to central banks that have relatively little scope to lower borrowing costs followed the Yen higher. The Swiss Franc and Euro – where the SNB and ECB have already brought policy rates into negative territory – outpaced gains in the British Pound, where there remains room for 75 basis points in cuts. Alternatives with greater room for easing – AUD and NZD – declined. The frequently oil-linked Canadian Dollar proved weakest of the pack however. Chart created with TradingView The US Dollar put in a mixed performance, rallying against cycle-sensitive and positively-yielding currencies while falling against the anti-risk side of the spectrum. The Fed is widely expected to cut rates again later this month after a surprise 50bp reduction last week amid market turmoil, narrowing USD’s yield advantage against the likes of the EUR and JPY. Its liquidity haven appeal is countervailing force however. Gold prices rose as safety-seeking capital flows sent US Treasury bonds higher, pulling down yields. That burnished the appeal of non-interest-bearing alternatives epitomized by the yellow metal. The return on the benchmark 10-year note probed below 0.5 percent while the cost of 30-year borrowing ticked below 1 percentfor the first time on record. Chart created with TradingView Stocks plunged in Asia-Pacific trade, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 suffering steep losses. Looking ahead, a steep drop in futures tracking the bellwether S&P 500 index plummeted to trade limit-down, activating a cap on losses at 5 percent. That appears to set the stage for continued liquidation in the hours ahead. --- Written by Ilya Spivak, Currency Strategist for DailyFX.com To contact Ilya, use the comments section below or @IlyaSpivak on Twitter	JPY
5e72ba590871625dfba541d0	Dollar strengthens, boosted by worries over coronavirus impact	The U.S. dollar rose against a basket of currencies for a third day on Thursday, as worries about the economic fallout from the coronavirus boosted dollar demand despite recent steps by world central banks aimed at alleviating market stress. The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six other major currencies, rose about 1.0% to 101.76, its highest since January 2017. The index is up about 3% for the week. “The dollar’s strength is, in effect, a powerful short-covering rally,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “It was used to fund a great part of the global circuit of capital. The circuit of capital is in reverse now, and the funding currency is being bought back,” Chandler said. The dollar’s rally has crushed several currencies to multi-year lows. The euro was 1.31% lower at $1.077, its weakest since April 2017, as traders rushed to dump euro positions despite a fresh round of stimulus from the European Central Bank. Though the European Central Bank announced a 750 billion euro (704 billion pounds) asset-purchase programme in response to the coronavirus outbreak, currency traders were not impressed. “While the ECB’s announcement has helped the bond market, it has done little for the euro,” said Chandler. The ECB’s purchase scheme, announced after an emergency meeting late on Wednesday, came less than a week after policymakers launched fresh stimulus measures. The fall in the euro mirrored a sudden widening in FX implied borrowing costs for the U.S. dollar, indicating that investors were rushing to secure their short-dated funding. “There are still fears about refinancing of European debt in U.S. dollars,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX and commodity research. “The swap facilities should normally give access to euro funding. But I think this is not calming down the market. There’s a general assumption that there are a lot of U.S. funding needs, not just in Europe but also around the world as a whole.” Though global central banks have pumped in billions of dollars in emergency liquidity injections in recent days and strengthened swap lines with some global central banks, dollar funding pressures remained exacerbated across the board. Investors are selling what they can to keep their money in dollars due to the unprecedented amount of uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which threatens to paralyse the global economy. The U.S. Federal Reserve opened the taps for central banks in 9 new countries to access dollars in hopes of preventing the coronavirus outbreak from causing a global economic rout. The dollar pared gains just before the Fed announcement. The British pound rallied 1.11% after the Bank of England cut interest rates to 0.1% and ramped up its bond-buying program.	USD
5e9612b087c2d7253bf36c46	USD/JPY Forecast: Bearish case firm in place	The USD/JPY pair fell for a fourth consecutive day to trade as low as 106.97 a level that was last seen on April 2. The Japanese currency benefited from the broad dollar’s weakness, surging despite the better market mood that led to most global equities to close in the green. Treasury yields ended the day flat amid stabilising coronavirus-numbers. The Japanese macroeconomic calendar has been quite scarce so far this week, with nothing relevant to report this Wednesday. The USD/JPY pair has managed to regain the 107.00 threshold ahead of the close but remained below 107.50, the 38.2% retracement of its latest bullish run and the immediate resistance. According to the 4-hour chart, the pair is bearish, as it has extended its decline below all of its moving averages, with the 20 SMA accelerating south. Technical indicators remain within negative levels, with moderated bearish strength, anyway skewing the risk to the downside. The next relevant support and bearish target is 106.50, the 50% retracement of the mentioned rally.

5e5d08eebd5d9d5ac07275fe	Gold Gap-and-Go Breakout: XAU Fresh Highs as Coronavirus Fear Spreads	Until this week, it was almost as if US equities were unaware or, perhaps just didn’t care about the spread of Coronavirus through Asia. While the backdrop otherwise was fairly supportive, with US economic data remaining relatively ‘ok’ along with the expectation for the Fed to soften later this year, stock prices continued to rise – punching up to a fresh all-time-high on Thursday of last week. But something shifted during the Thursday trading session – and I had discussed this in-depth in my webinar that afternoon. A quick rush of selling enveloped the S&P 500, and it appeared as though that hit came out of nowhere as there wasn’t an individual headline or driver to point to. Such observations can be worrying, as it becomes more obvious that something is lurking below-the-surface; and since then the risk aversion has only hastened as a series of negative reports this weekend indicate further spread of Coronavirus, sparking fears of a pandemic that may soon stretch globally. Gold prices have remained bid for much of the past two weeks, and of recent, as that risk aversion theme has further priced-in to global markets, buyers have rushed to the bid to craft fresh seven-year-highs. This week’s open brought a gap into play as prices opened above the 1650 level, quickly catching a bit of resistance at the 1680 Fibonacci level. Buyers pushed forward around the European open, temporarily scaling above this price on the way to setting that fresh seven-year-high. Chart prepared by James Stanley; Gold on Tradingview I had looked at the long side of Gold as one of my top ideas for 2020, the primary root cause being the expectation for the FOMC to get more loose and passive this year. And while markets have ramped up expectations for cuts out of the FOMC, the bank hasn’t yet opened the door to any such moves. In Gold prices, it appears that fear and future expectations around the FOMC as a response to those fears is what’s doing most of the driving. At this point, both Gold and the US Dollar are in rally-mode, and this goes along with the move in Treasuries as the 30-year has hit a record low yield while the 10-year isn’t far behind. This is a fairly clear indication of investors pushing into ‘safe-haven’ vehicles like Gold or US Treasuries; making the continued move of strength in equities all the more befuddling. But now that equities are starting to show some of that pain, the source of strength in Gold and Treasuries makes more sense; investors are ducking for cover as a new, unknown variable of risk is permeating through global markets. This has helped to keep the long side of Gold as well-bid, accented by a series of breakouts already in 2020 trade as the yellow metal marches up to fresh seven-year-highs. At this point, a bit of resistance is playing in off of the 14.4% retracement of the long-term move in Gold prices, taken from the low set in 1999 and drawn up to the high in 2011. Notice how on the monthly chart below, RSI is in overbought territory, indicating just how aggressive this move has been as buyers have hurried into ‘safe haven’ assets like Gold. Chart prepared by James Stanley; Gold on Tradingview Gold prices are overbought by a number of metrics, with RSI above the 70 marker on hourly, four-hour, daily, weekly and monthly charts. The bigger question is whether this will matter throughout this week as fear has come into the equation in a rather pronounced manner. This could allow for a continued topside bias, although traders would likely want to exercise a good deal of prudence in looking to work around the move given the overbought readings that are showing on most relevant Gold charts. This could keep the door open for continued breakout potential, looking for prints of fresh highs to continue running-higher. This approach would, at the least, allow for traders to place relatively tight risk protocols so that if the breakout doesn’t continue to run-higher, the trade could be abandoned with the goal of loss mitigation. Alternatively, for traders that can check their FOMO (fear of missing out), there remains some unfilled gap on the chart from this week’s open, and that zone of unfilled gap can be assigned as potential support: That zone currently runs from the approximate 1643 (last week’s close) up to 1651 (this week’s open). As of this writing, retail traders are heavily long Gold, which further denotes the need for patience until some form of pullback may come into play for trend-based strategies.

5e7e70d90cb5617235ba78af	Dollar posts biggest weekly fall since 2009	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar posted its biggest weekly decline in more than a decade on Friday, as trillions of dollars worth of stimulus efforts by governments and central banks helped temper a rout in global markets driven by the coronavirus pandemic. The dollar surged in March as tumbling stock and debt markets caused a scramble for the world’s most liquid currency. But big government spending pledges and coordinated efforts by central banks around the world to increase the supply of dollars have supported a rally in other major currencies. The U.S. House of Representatives on Friday approved a $2.2 trillion aid package - the largest in American history - to help people and businesses cope with the economic downturn inflicted by the coronavirus outbreak. The dollar dipped 0.87% against a basket of currencies Friday to 98.41. It fell 3.90% this week - its biggest weekly decline since March 2009. The dollar index last week had racked up its biggest weekly gain since the financial crisis. “What we are seeing is abating stress in the money markets. Action by central banks has been successful so far and a shortage of dollars has been taken off the table,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX and commodity research at Commerzbank. After this month’s large price swings, investors were likely to be especially active rebalancing their books for month- and quarter-end. The Global Foreign Exchange Committee on Thursday warned the coming few sessions could be volatile as market participants execute larger than normal trades as part of this process. Against the yen, the dollar fell 1.56% on Friday to 107.87 yen, as Japanese investors and companies repatriated funds before their fiscal year ends next week. The euro gained 0.83% against the greenback to $1.1119. Sterling jumped 2.07% to $1.2454 and the Australian dollar rose 1.78% to $0.6171. Speculators increased their net short dollar position in the latest week to $8.88 billion, from $8.27 billion the previous week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. [IMM/FX] “Now that the surge in demand for dollars overseas has been met by the Fed’s new improved swap lines, economic and medical fundamentals are taking over,” Marshall Gittler, head of investment research at BDSwiss Group, said in a note on Friday.

5e5d08d3bd5d9d5ac07275e0	Yen Outlook Bullish, USD/JPY May Fall as S&P 500 Sees Dip Buying	In this week’s session, I discussed the outlook for the Japanese Yen against the US Dollar and Australian Dollar while covering a broad sweep of the S&P 500. After the latter experienced some of its worst performance since 2018, the anti-risk JPY gained aggressively as fears on the coronavirus increased. From here, what do traders’ buy/sell bets have to say about the USD/JPY and S&P 500 outlook? At the time of this writing, IG Client Sentiment (IGCS) is reporting that about 49.69% of traders are net-long USD/JPY. Traders are less net short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that USD/JPY may soon reverse lower despite traders remaining net short. From a psychological standpoint, this would speak to an increasing amount of participants attempting to buy the dip. After failing to clear highs from 2019, USD/JPY has turned sharply lower towards rising support from August – red line on the chart below. Clearing 110.29 would pave the way for a revisit of 109.55 along the path towards the rising trend line. If the latter is taken out, that could shift the medium-term outlook to bearish as prices could reverse the key uptrend from the latter half of last year. USD/JPY Chart Created in Trading View According to IGCS at the time of this writing, roughly 42.32% of traders are net-long the S&P 500. That is up from just under a 25% upside bias from last week. Since then, prices have declined over 7.6%. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current US 500 price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact that traders remain net-short. That would represent a rising share of participants attempting to pick the bottom. Despite near-term declines, the medium-term technical picture for the S&P 500 arguably remains bullish. Taking a look at futures, rising support from 2018 caught Tuesday’s aggressive selloff – blue lines on the chart below. A close to the downside followed by confirmation risks shifting the technical outlook to bearish from here. That may be the case if signals from trader positioning transpire.

5e709a3f47e77e097e11db0a	Dollar stands tall as nervous investors stick with safety	LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar stood tall on Tuesday, recouping losses against the yen and hitting new highs against riskier currencies, as nervous traders stuck with the most liquid currency amid very fragile sentiment. Market liquidity was tight and investors remained very cautious after coordinated moves by central banks failed to quell anxiety about the coronavirus pandemic. Investors are now waiting to see the scale of government fiscal responses to battle the economic fallout from the virus and limit the economic contraction. Money managers and businesses are scrambling for dollars as the outlook grows darker by the day. China has reported a fresh rise in cases. Malaysia is preparing to enter lockdown amid ever tighter measures in Europe and the United States. “The dollar can hold onto its gains as markets understandably remain very fragile, but when the dust settles, we think the dollar will end up a little lower,” ING analysts said, while adding that the best level for the dollar index would be between 99 and 100. The U.S. dollar index =USD on Tuesday rose 0.3% to 98.444, close to its recent high of 98.817. The euro dropped 0.5% to $1.1130 EUR=EBS while sterling sank to its weakest since September, down as much as 0.6% at $1.2192 GBP=D3. The dollar rallied 1% versus the yen to 107 yen, reversing much of its losses on Monday JPY=EBS. The Australian dollar AUD=D3, seen as sensitive to global growth due to the country's link to commodities, fell 0.7% to a new 11-year low of $0.6065. Volatility, which has doubled in forex markets in the space of a few weeks, has not been as pronounced in currency markets as it has in equity and bond markets, and analysts said that despite the poor liquidity and large moves, trading had been relatively orderly. Investors are also shunning many emerging market currencies. MSCI's emerging market currency index .MIEM00000CUS dropped 0.3%, staying at its lowest level since late 2018. The Korean won KRW= hit its lowest since 2010. Investors have taken central bank action from the U.S. Federal Reserve and policymakers in Japan, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere, as insufficient given the pathogen’s breakneck spread across the world which has put many nations on virtual lockdowns. Some analysts said the hasty moves may have backfired. “Central banks are pressing the gas pedal to the floor. But the car is bogged down in a quagmire that is called coronavirus, so it won’t move forward,” said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. “Until the outbreak stops, for investors, it is time for patience.” Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo; Editing by Catherine Evans	USD
5e5d3390c8e6c313e7384ff1	If Central Banks are Cutting Rates, Someone Forgot to Tell USD/CHF	With the coronavirus running amuck causing fears of a stalled world economy for Q1 and possibly even Q2, there has been talk of possible rate cuts by Central Banks around the globe, including the Federal Reserve. Although many have questioned how this will help people get back on planes and cruise ships, stock markets are taking this as a positive signal. Over the last 10 years or so, bad news is good, as the Fed has been there as a backstop to falling stock markets. As a result, US stock markets have opened the week in positive territory. If talk of central banks cutting rates is positive, someone forgot to tell USD/CHF, as the fight to safety still seems to be in full effect. Granted, Manufacturing PMI for Feb from Switzerland did come out to better at 49.5 vs 48.1 expected and 47.8 last, however the PMIs are not the driver of markets these days. The Swiss Frac has always been a flight to safety currency and as a result, it is still going bid (USD/CHF lower)! On a daily timeframe, USD/CHF moved lower in December to the target of the double top near .9662. Price then before traded sideways through January, before bouncing to the resistance and the neckline of the double top and the 200 Day Moving Average near .9850. As stocks sold off in mid-February, so did USD/CHF, as traders sought to move out of stocks in into the Swiss Frac. The pair currently is trading near horizontal support at .9550, which is the September 18th , 2019 lows. Bulls may be looking to buy near here, with stops below the September lows. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com On a 240-minute timeframe, the lows also coincide with the 127.2% extension from the low in early February to the highs at .9850. The RSI is diverging slightly, which may allow the pair stay around here as the RSI winds. Horizontal resistance near .9615/30. Bears will look to sell bounce near this level. Support is at the 161.8% Fibonacci extension from the same time period, near .9430, which is also within a band of support on the daily timeframe. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Whether or not central banks decide to cut rates in response to a slowdown from the coronavirus, it still seems as if not all market participants think it will help. We are still seeing the flight to safety trade in USD/CHF.	CHF
5e87a58303a8ca1d41c3c51e	Dollar climbs on safe-haven bids; shrugs off horrible U.S. jobs number	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar firmed against major currencies for a third straight day on Friday, as investors took shelter in the U.S. currency amid worsening economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. “As we see poor data coming in from Europe, UK, Italy, if you’re trying to be rushing anywhere, it would be U.S. Treasuries and the U.S. dollar as a safe haven,” said John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading at Tempus Inc in Washington. The dollar largely shrugged off the U.S. non-farm payrolls report that showed massive job losses of 701,000 last month, compared with expectations of 100,000 lost jobs. March’s contraction abruptly ended a historic 113 straight months of employment growth. The Labor Department also revised February’s number upward to 275,000 job gains. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4% from 3.5% the previous month. “The plunge in non-farm payrolls in March, which is already close to the worst monthly declines during the global financial crisis, suggests the coronavirus pandemic started to decimate the economy even sooner than we thought,” said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. The non-farm payrolls report followed Thursday’s data showing initial claims for U.S. unemployment benefits rose to 6.65 million in the latest week from an unrevised 3.3 million the previous week. In afternoon trading, the U.S. dollar index was up 0.4% at 100.61. The index posted a 2.3% gain on the week, having whipsawed last month from highs on a scramble for cash before slumping as the U.S. Federal Reserve flooded the market with liquidity. The euro was down 0.4% against the dollar at $1.0810 , on pace for a 2.9% weekly loss. Indecision among euro zone governments about a rescue package for the region’s hobbled economies has weakened the euro in recent days. The Japanese yen, Swiss franc, sterling, as well asthe Australian and New Zealand dollars all lost ground as the dollar strengthened across the board.. The dollar was last up 0.5% at 108.42 yen. As lockdowns continue, the economic impact of the epidemic is becoming more marked, with purchasing managers’ indexes across the euro zone and Britain on Friday showing a slump in business activity. “The complication is that while all the things that the governments have done are very positive, they’re like extra welfare payments and they can’t do anything more than that,” said Adrian Lee, president and chief investment officer at active currency manager Adrian Lee & Partners. “When we do come out of lockdowns, everybody will be desynchronized. China comes out first, then Italy comes out. But the world is so interconnected. It’s not great when you can work in the U.S., but you can’t visit London.” Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Additional reporting by Iain Withers in London; Editing by Nick Zieminski, Dan Grebler and Jonathan Oatis	USD
5e7eafeb804aa921c2204528	Australian Dollar Boosted By Stimulus Hope, Coronavirus Stays in Charge	The Australian Dollar market faces a new trading week very short of domestic cues although, even were there a full slate, the spread of coronavirus would still doubtless remain in charge. Recent sessions have seen the Australian Dollar revive somewhat, along with other growth correlated assets such as stocks and energy. This surprising comparative vigor came even as more economies placed heavy restrictions on economic activity in the hope that taking that hit now would pay of later in containing and reducing infection levels. The real support for risk assets has come in the various massive stimulus and rescue programs now being implemented or discussed across the globe. Trillions of dollars of liquidity have been pledged, if needed, along with more targeted help for hard hit economic sectors. This monetary and fiscal largesse has even managed to offset some truly horrific economic data, which will now trickle out more and more regularly as the release cycle catches up with the impact of the virus. Worst so far was the release of truly shocking weekly jobless benefit claimant figures out of the US. A rise of over 3 million initial claims in just one week is unprecedented for this series which goes back to the 1960s. Still, even this huge blowout was hardly unexpected and markets managed to retain at least the appearance of composure. Investors are at least confident that global economic authorities are putting major remedial action in place, and it’s possible that uber-liquid markets could bounce back quite sharply should infection rates start to slow. Whether there’ll be any sign of that in the coming week is unknowable. The Australian Dollar market is likely to face more bad news in the shape of Purchasing Managers Index releases out of China, Australia’s major export partner, and official retail sales data out of Australia itself. These are almost sure to be extremely week, but the market can by now hardly expect anything else. We’ve seen in the past week’s trade that the Australian Dollar can rise despite the gloomy headlines as long as investors retain confidence in the authorities. However, the most recent rush of terrible economic news is likely to be only the start, and it’s very hard to see a durable risk asset recovery while that’s the case. On the basis of what we can know, it’s a bearish call this week. Whether you’re new to trading or an old hand DailyFX has plenty of resources to help you.

5e81b5e9c496d2354de73020	Dollar supported by risk aversion trading	Friday March 22: Five things the markets are talking about Global equities are trading mixed after the European Union agreed Thursday to a short Brexit delay. Investors are also weighing up further signs of a sluggish global economy as a plethora of G7 central banks reassess normalizing their monetary policies. U.S treasury yields have fallen back to a 12-month low, while the 10-year German Bund is flirting with negative territory. In FX, sterling (£1.3103) remains very volatile as EU leaders have moved to stop a “chaotic no-deal Brexit” from happening next week by handing PM Theresa May an extra fortnight unconditional extension. The U.K must decide by April 12 what it will do next. They can either decide whether to hold European Parliament elections or leave the bloc on May 7, with or without a divorce deal with Brussels. Elsewhere, the EUR (€1.1289) has dropped to a one-week low, after weak French, German and Eurozone purchasing managers’ surveys prints for March this morning. On tap: Canadian CPI and core-retail sales (8:30 am EDT).z 1. Stocks mixed performance In Japan, the Nikkei closed out the week little changed as chip-related stocks offset weakness in financial stocks. The Nikkei share average closed up +0.1%. The index rose +0.8% for the week, while the broader Topix rose +0.2% overnight. Down-under, Aussie stocks rallied on Friday, led by financial and healthcare stocks as the market mirrored Wall Street after strong U.S economic data eased worries about a slowing economy. The S&P/ASX 200 index climbed +0.45%. The benchmark gained +0.3% on the week. In S. Korea, the Kospi index ended flat overnight on heavy profit taking. For the week, the index gained +0.5%. In China, stocks closed out almost flat ahead of a new round of Sino-U.S trade talks next week (Mar 28-29), but posted weekly gains of about +2.5% on expectations of more policy measures to spur domestic growth. The blue-chip CSI300 index fell -0.1%, while the Shanghai Composite Index was flat. It was a similar story in Hong Kong as stocks closed the week unchanged. In Europe, regional indices trade sharply lower, reversing earlier gains, after both France and Germany manufacturing PMI’s (see below) missed forecasts and entered into contractionary territory. U.S stocks are set to open in the ‘red’ (-0.4%) Indices: Stoxx600 -0.44% at 379.04, FTSE -0.75% at 7,299.85, DAX -0.58% 11,482.52, CAC-40 -0.78% at 5,336.94, IBEX-35 -0.67% at 5,336.94, FTSE MIB -0.85% at 21,190.50, SMI -0.34% at 9,421.90, S&P 500 Futures -0.40% 2. Oil trades atop 2019 highs on OPEC+ supply cuts, U.S sanctions, gold lower Oil hovers just shy of this year’s high, supported by ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC+ and by U.S sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. However, market worries about an economic slowdown is capping crude prices from rallying further. Brent crude oil futures are at +$67.92 per barrel, +6c above Thursday’s close. Brent hit a four-month high of +$68.69 per barrel yesterday. U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures are at +$60.04 per barrel, up +5c. WTI printed a 2019 high in Thursday’s session at +$60.39. Market consensus believes that OPEC is likely to extend its current supply cut deal for the duration of 2019 when they next meet in Vienna in June. Russia has been a reluctant partner in the supply cuts but is expected to opt to preserve the deal and retain a leadership role within the group that accounts for +45 % of total global oil output. Support for the ‘black stuff’ has also come from U.S sanctions against OPEC-members Iran and Venezuela. Note: Iranian crude oil shipments have averaged just over +1M bpd this month, down from +1.3M bpd in February, while in Venezuela, production has plummeted from +3M bpd in 2000 to +1M bpd in 2019. Ahead of the U.S open, gold has extended its losses, moving further away from its three-week high print from yesterday, as appetite for some risk improved on upbeat U.S economic data. The ‘yellow’ metal remains on course for a third consecutive weekly gain. Spot gold is down -0.1% at +$1,308.26 per ounce, after touching its highest since Feb. 28 at +$1,320.22 Thursday. The metal has rallied +0.5% so far this week. U.S gold futures are flat at +$1,307.50 an ounce. 3. German Bunds yields turn negative The German 10-year Bund yield turned temporarily negative this morning for the first time in three-years (October 2016), after poor manufacturing data (see below) fuelled concerns about slowing growth in the eurozone’s largest economy. The German 10-year government bond yield hit a day’s low of -0.001% Germany’s manufacturing sector had contracted for the third consecutive month. Elsewhere, the yield on 10-year Treasuries fell -1 bps to +2.53%, while in Japan the 10-year JGB yield dipped -3 bps to -0.069% on the biggest pullback in three-months after disappointing data overnight. Note: Japan’s National CPI came in a tad light – +0.2% vs. +0.3%e y/y; CPI ex-fresh food +0.7% vs. +0.8%e vs. +0.8% prior. Japan’s March Preliminary PMI Manufacturing was 48.9 vs. 49.9e (second consecutive contraction). 4. Dollar supported by risk aversion trading Weaker EU PMI data this morning – French, German and Eurozone all in contraction – has encouraged risk aversion flows. The EUR has declined over -0.63% outright ahead of the U.S open to probe back below the psychological €1.13 to a one-week low of €1.1289. GBP/USD continues its volatile Brexit ways. The pound saw its initial gains eroded back to test below £1.31, where it has found some support after EU stepped up to avoid a hard Brexit from occurring next week and gave the U.K an extra two week of an ‘unconditional extension’ now set at Apr 12. If the U.K parliament agrees on PM May’s deal, the U.K. will leave the EU on May 22. If it doesn’t, the U.K. will either ask for a longer Brexit extension or crash out without a deal on April 12, the new deadline for Brexit. USD/JPY is lower on safe-haven flows to test ¥110.48 in the session. 5. German manufacturing contracts further Data this morning from IHS Markit showed that Germany’s export-heavy manufacturing sector fell deeper into contraction this month. Its German manufacturing PMI fell to 44.7 from 47.6 in February, which marks the lowest level in over six-and-a-half years. The index has now fallen in 14 of the past 15 months. “The downturn in Germany’s manufacturing sector has become more entrenched, with March’s flash data showing accelerated declines in output, new orders and exports,” IHS Markit economist Phil Smith says. The latest set of national and eurozone purchasing managers’ data should certainly add to downside risks for the EU’s economy and increase further pressure on the ECB.

5e5d31c7d3c8fc0aa1ab81e2	The Fall Of The Mexican Peso	Last week we discussed how yen and emerging markets (such as the Mexican peso) were being sold and currencies like the U.S. dollar and the euro were bought. Our reasoning was that Japan’s largest pension fund (GPIF) was selling yen for reallocation. At the time, stock markets were not as fearful of the spread of the coronavirus as they have been over the last few days. As stock indices have been moving lower around the world, more fuel has been added to the fire for a weakening Mexican peso. At the time of last week’s writing, USD/MXN had just broken higher and closed at the top of the small blue channel within the larger green channel, near 18.85. Since then, the pair has sliced through resistance at the top of the larger green channel, the 200-day moving average and the bottom trendline of the longer-term triangle and 50% retracement level from the August 29 highs to the February 17 lows. If stocks continue to move lower, dips will be bought. Next resistance is at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the same period near 19.60 and the top downward sloping trendline of the longer-term triangle near 19.95/20.00. Note that the RSI is in overbought territory. However, when markets are in strong trends, oscillators such as the RSI can become “more overbought.” Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com On a 240-minute timeframe, support is back at the 50% retracement level and the upward sloping trendline from the long-term triangle near 19.40. Below that is small horizontal support at 19.2620 and below that at the downward sloping green channel trendline near 19.05. The RSI is diverging in overbought territory, however, as previously mentioned, oscillators can not be relied upon during strong trends. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Yesterday, we discussed how EUR/USD has been bid this week despite stock indices moving lower. The reasoning was due to the unwind of the carry trade. Today a new factor was thrown into the euro mix, which may help euro pairs continue to move higher: The German government is considering a possible stimulus program in case the coronavirus epidemic hits the German economy Hard (Handelsblatt). These factors have helped send EUR/MXN soaring over the past week. Last week, price in EUR/MXN broke out of a falling wedge, which targeted 21.00. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com On a daily timeframe, we can see that price has broken through the target level at 21.00 and then some. EUR/MXN has traded up to a high today near 21.44. Resistance above is at 21.50/21.58, which is a confluence of Fibonacci levels and Fibonacci extensions. Above there is horizontal resistance at 21.75 and finally the highs from August 26, 2019 at 22.46. There is near-term support at the 200-day moving average at 21.32, however below that the next level of support isn’t until the day’s lows and top of the falling wedge at 21.00. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com As long as stocks are moving lower, the carry trade should continue to unwind. Add in German stimulus and official selling of yen, and EUR/MXN and USD/MNX should remain bid. (With stocks off nearly 10% from highs and USD/JPY hanging around 110, it appears someone is selling yen near these levels). However, be weary of a bounce in stocks as there is always the possibility of profit taking/stop-loss run. Buyers will be looking for pullbacks to support to get long the peso pairs.	MXN
5e7900508f11df275168b4c1	Canadian Dollar Price Outlook: USD/CAD Virus Breakout may be Overdone	The Canadian Dollar remains on the defensive against the US Dollar early in the week but takes USD/CAD into a key technical resistance zone we’ve been tracking for some time. While the broader outlook remains weighted to the topside, the immediate advance may be vulnerable IF price is unable to mount a close above this threshold. These are the updated targets and invalidation levels that matter on the USD/CAD price charts heading into Jobs Friday. Review my latest Weekly Strategy Webinar for an in-depth breakdown of this Loonie trade setup and more. Chart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Technical Strategist; USD/CAD on Tradingview Technical Outlook: In my last Canadian Dollar Price Outlook we noted that USD/CAD was testing, “uptrend resistance (risk for near-term exhaustion) with a breach / weekly close above 1.4565 needed to fuel the next leg higher in price.” Price briefly registered a high at 1.4667 last week but failed to mark a daily close above confluence resistance at the 61.8% parallel (blue) / 2016 high-close / 100% ext at 1.4534/65. Note that daily RSI is deep in overbought territory and while momentum is on the side of the bulls, the price advance may be vulnerable near-term while below this threshold. Notes: A closer look at Loonie price action shows USD/CAD failing last week on building divergence into the highs before pulling back. Price is once again testing this resistance zone into the start of the week- look for a reaction here. A close above exposes the 2016 high at 1.4690 backed by the upper parallel of the ascending pitchfork formation extending off the 2016/2017 lows, currently around 1.4930s. Weekly open support rests at 1.4352 backed by the 2016 high-week close at 1.4115. Ultimately a break / close below the 38.2% retracement at 1.4014 would be needed to suggest a larger correction is underway with such a scenario exposing 1.3793-1.3812 and the 61.8% retracement / 20178 high-day close at 1.3610/47 – both areas of interest for possible downside exhaustion IF reached. Bottom line: The USD/CAD rally is testing lateral resistance here at 1.4534/65 and the immediate advance may be vulnerable IF price holds this threshold into the close. Form a trading standpoint, a good spot to reduce long-exposure / raise protective stops. The weekly opening-rangeis taking shape just below resistance – look to the break for guidance here. Ultimately, a larger pullback may offer more favorable entries with a breach higher exposing longer-term slope resistance above the 1.49-handle.

5e6f006661d2b24da982255a	Economic Data and Monetary Policy Kick Off the Week with a Bang	It was a busy start to the week on economic calendar this morning. The Aussie Dollar was in action by proxy through the early part of the day, with economic data out of China in focus. The RBNZ and FOMC were also in the limelight, with press conferences to announce rate cuts ahead of the Asian open. Industrial production, fixed asset investment and unemployment figures for February were the key drivers. According to figures released by NBS, The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.61278 to $0.61297 upon release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was down by 0.58% to $0.6167. At the time of writing, the Japanese Yen was up by 0.67% to ¥106.90 against the U.S Dollar. The FED slashed interest rates to zero in the early hours, whilst also delivering QE5. Rates were cut by 50 basis points to a target range of 0 to 0.25%, with the FED also launching a bazooka $700bn QE program to add further support to the economy. With the FOMC meeting scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, it was classified as another emergency maneuver… The EUR/USD moved from $1.1189 to $1.11752 upon the announcement. The RBNZ joined central banks globally, delivering a 75bps emergency rate cut in the early hours of this morning. There was also the promise of an asset purchasing program in the event that more support is required. The rate cut to 0.25% is to take effect from 17th March and will remain at 0.25% for a minimum of 12-months. The Kiwi Dollar moved from $0.6074 to $0.61465 upon the announcement. At the time of writing, the Kiwi Dollar flat at $0.6167. It’s a quiet day ahead on the economic calendar. Economic data is limited to finalized February inflation figures out of Italy. We will expect the numbers to have a muted impact on the EUR, however. The market focus will be on government steps to contain the spread of the virus and counter the impact on the Eurozone economy. Last week, we saw the ECB support bank lending by offering -0.75% lending rates to banks to support businesses and consumers. While businesses will look for loans to raise the chances of survival, consumers will not be spending with member states in lockdown mode… This doesn’t bode well for the Eurozone economy, with the unemployment rate likely to spike in response… We can also expect the markets to also respond further to the FED rate cut to zero… At the time of writing, the EUR was up by 0.16% at $1.1125. It’s a particularly quiet day ahead on the economic calendar, with no material stats due out of the UK to provide direction. The lack of stats will leave the Pound on the defensive as the number of cases and deaths rose over the weekend. We’ve seen capital outflows and sentiment towards monetary policy already sink the Pound. More of the same could well be on the cards as Brexit negotiations get put on ice. At the time of writing, the Pound was up by 0.63% to $1.2355, the upside coming from the weaker Dollar. It’s a relatively quiet day ahead on the U.S economic calendar. NY Empire State Manufacturing Index numbers for March are due out. The figures will give the markets an idea of what impact the spread of the coronavirus has had on the sector. Back in February, the Index had risen from 4.8 to 12.9. Outside of the numbers, updates on the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S will also need considering as will chatter from the Oval Office. Trump will be looking to push through fiscal policy measures. A number of Republicans have raised eyebrows over some of the proposals. Failure to pass proposals through will raise further doubts over a Trump 2nd term. Earlier in the day, the FED’s rate cut to zero left the Dollar Spot Index deep in the red, with U.S Futures on the bounce. The Dollar Spot Index was down by 0.43% to 98.324 at the time of writing. It’s a quiet day ahead on the economic calendar, with no material stats due out of Canada to provide the Loonie with direction. The lack of stats will continue to leave the Loonie in the hands of crude oil prices and market risk sentiment on the day. The Loonie was down by 0.28% at C$1.3845 against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing, with economic data out of China contributing to the downside.	USD
5e5d0901bd5d9d5ac0727616	Australian Dollar Forecast: Key AUD/USD Levels to Watch as Breakdown Unfolds	Australian Dollar Analysis and Talking Points AUD/USD   The Australian Dollar has remained under pressure amid the rising concerns over the spread of the Coronavirus, while domestic data has also softened, most notably, the labour market report. As such, the currency is trading at an 11-year low against the dominant greenback Throughout the week, the latest employment data showed that the unemployment rate edged higher to 5.3%, above the expected 5.2%. Although, while this keeps the door open to further easing from the RBA, given that Governor Lowe stated that the unemployment rate needs to move materially higher, it would take another soft labour report to force the central banks hand. That said, we feel that near-term easing prospects will keep the Aussie contained with unemployment indicators signalling further deterioration. On the technical front, the outlook remains bearish for the Australian Dollar with upticks likely to be brief and shallow. Yesterday saw AUD/USD make a firm break below support at 0.6660-70, in turn with pair now trading below 0.6600, eyes are for a test of support situated at 0.6550. On the upside, prior support at 0.6660, is now likely to curb gains, while resistance is also situated at 0.6730.

5e5d08a4bd5d9d5ac07275ca	EUR/USD Soars on Global Equity Panic Selling, Beware of Month-end Rebalancing - US Market Open	MARKET DEVELOPMENT Analysis Equities: A sea of red yet again as global equities remain under heavy selling pressure. Consequently, US bond yields have once again printed fresh record lows with the 10yr yielding 1.26% and money markets pricing over 2 rate cuts this year from the Fed. That said, while the spread of the coronavirus has continued to spark panic, the rate of recoveries has been outpacing the rate of new cases over the past week (Figure 1). Alongside this, we are also cognisant of the fact that with month-end looming, given the outperformance in bonds over equities (US bonds outperforming S&P 500 by over 6%), there is a potential for portfolio rebalancing to pave the way for a sizeable bounce across equities in the absence of more negative virus related newsflow. Figure 1. Coronavirus Recovery Rate Higher Than New Case Rate Source: gisanddata coronavirus EUR: Carry unwind and shorts heading for the exit push the Euro towards 1.10 against the greenback. As such, the currency is on course for its strongest daily gain since August 2019. That said, the outlook remains weak for the Eurozone and thus a break above the 1.1000 may be somewhat difficult to maintain. GBP: The UK announced its mandate for trade talks with the EU and as expected, the UK have maintained their pledge that they are willing to fall onto WTO terms should talks with the EU fail. However, more interestingly, the UK noted that a decision as to whether a no-deal would take place, may be as soon as June, which marks the deadline for the UK to ask for an extension to the transition period.

5e601ad0f836eb7b6e84e48c	Dollar recovers after Fed rate cut hit	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar recovered lost ground against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, a day after an emergency interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve knocked the U.S. currency to an eight-week low. The U.S. central bank surprised investors by slashing rates by 50 basis points to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%, two weeks ahead of a regularly scheduled policy meeting, in an effort to combat the economic impact of the coronavirus. The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was 0.19% higher at 97.315. The index slipped as low as 96.926 on Tuesday, its weakest level since Jan. 8. “The dollar has found its feet after a phase of underperformance against the euro and some other major currencies,” Jonathan Coughtrey, managing director at Action Economics, said in a note. Data on Wednesday also provided a boost. U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in February, pointing to labor market strength before a recent escalation of recession fears ignited by the coronavirus epidemic. A rise in U.S. services sector activity to a one-year high in February also suggested underlying strength in the economy despite the coronavirus outbreak. Even so, analysts were hesitant to call for a big rebound for the dollar. “The Fed still has more room to cut than other major central banks,” said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. “What that means in functional terms is that the dollar’s downside is a little bit larger.” On Wednesday, the euro, which has been one of the currencies to climb on the broad-based dollar weakness of recent weeks, was 0.28% lower at $1.114. “With the ECB about to cut imminently, it has deflated the euro balloon a bit,” Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at Australian FX services provider AxiCorp, said, referring to the European Central Bank. Money markets in the euro zone are pricing a 90% chance that the ECB will cut its deposit rate, now minus 0.50%, by 10 basis points next week. The Canadian dollar weakened against the greenback on Wednesday after the Bank of Canada slashed its benchmark interest rate to 1.25% from 1.75% due to the coronavirus outbreak and said it was prepared to cut again if needed to support economic growth. Sterling rose 0.44% against the dollar, as incoming Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey hurt expectations for a BoE rate cut by saying that any measures to counter the economic hit from the coronavirus outbreak would be best done in tandem with Britain’s government.

5e683f9fb4b3263100fc3582	Dollar resumes descent against safe-haven currencies in volatile trade	TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar resumed its descent against the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc on Wednesday after a rebound the previous day as nervous sentiment over the coronavirus epidemic persisted. The moves mirrored falls in U.S. equity futures and U.S. bond yields in early trade in Asia on Wednesday, with most investors still on the sidelines even after risk assets made some recovery on Tuesday on hopes governments will take measures to ease the economic pain from the epidemic. Against the yen, the dollar lost 0.6% to 104.98 yen JPY=, down almost a full yen from Tuesday's high. The Swiss franc also gained 0.25% to 0.9369 franc per dollar CHF= while the euro stood at $1.1304 EUR=, up 0.21% so far in Asia. “Liquidity is so thin at the moment. There are very few orders in the market, most of which appear to come from algorithm players,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities. “All we can say is trade will remain volatile for the time being.” The dollar had jumped back on Tuesday as investors hoped global monetary policymakers will launch further stimulus plans aimed at bolstering economies hit by trade and travel disruptions. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he will ask Congress for a payroll tax cut and other “very major” stimulus moves, although the details remain unclear. “It is too early to say the market sentiment has turned positive. Yesterday’s rebound in the dollar and in risk assets is a type of a rebound you often see in a downtrend,” said Shinji Ishimaru, senior currency analyst at MUFG Bank. “In addition to economic measures, the focus will be on how much the U.S. can contain the infections to keep the economy going. That is a very big unknown,” he said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on Tuesday 696 cases of coronavirus, an increase of 224 from its previous count, and said the number of deaths had risen by six to 25. Financial markets are also expecting the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by at least 0.5 percentage point at its policy review next week, in addition to its emergency rate reduction earlier this month. That will essentially diminish the dollar’s yield advantage over other major currencies, which has been a main driver of the dollar’s strength in the past few years.

5e869a4bbb89237a08c15d87	Aussie and kiwi may be past the worst, if analysts right - Reuters poll	SYDNEY (Reuters) - Analysts think the worst may already be over for the hard-hit Australian and New Zealand dollars and see them slowly regaining ground over the year ahead, a surprising mark of faith given the economic carnage caused by the coronavirus. Analysts polled by Reuters see the Aussie at $0.6020 AUD=D3 in one month, just under the $0.6055 level it was trading at on Friday. That was a steep downgrade from the $0.6700 predicted in the last poll in February, reflecting the wild swings seen since then. Indeed, the market was so manic a poll could not be conducted properly in March. The Aussie plunged from $0.6700 to a 17-year low of $0.5510 in a nine-day period in early March, as the spread of the virus sent global markets into a tailspin. Now, the median forecast was for the Aussie to creep up to $0.6100 in three months, $0.6300 in six and $0.6600 on a one-year horizon. Yet estimates ranged widely - from $0.5200 to $0.6800 on a three-month view - reflecting uncertainty on how long the economic impact of the pandemic might last. Economists fear Australian output (GDP) could fall by 5% or more this quarter, from the first quarter, even though the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut rates to a record low of 0.25% and the government launched a massive stimulus package. With much of the world also shut down, that is a wall of worry to climb for a commodity-leveraged currency such as the Aussie. “Growing fears that prolonged shutdowns around the world will exacerbate the global economic contraction will keep AUD and NZD on the back foot in our view,” said Joseph Capurso, a senior currency strategist at CBA. “We still expect AUD to fall to $0.5700, and probably lower, while NZD is heading for $0.5500, and probably lower.” The kiwi has fared almost as badly as the Aussie in the past month, tumbling to a decade low of $0.5469 NZD=D3 at one stage in March, before bouncing somewhat to $0.5895. Again median forecasts suggested it was near a floor, with $0.5900 seen in one month and $0.6000 in three. Estimates ranged all the way from $0.5200 to $0.6500. From there, analysts tipped it at $0.6100 in six months and $0.6400 on a one-year horizon. Polling by Sujith Pai, Indradip Ghosh and Khushboo Mittal; Editing by Jacqueline Wong	NZD
5e955997f2ec1369cbefc86a	USD/JPY: Is the pair going to extend its last arm from the C point?	USD/JPY has been bearish for the last five trading days. The pair may end up producing an ABC pattern on the daily chart, and yesterday's daily candle came out as a bearish candle. Thus the intraday sellers using timeframes such as H4 and H1 may look for shorting opportunities in the pair and drive the price down. The daily sellers should wait for the price to make a breakout at the lastest lowest low to short the pair again. Let us have a look at those three charts. The chart shows that the price produced a bearish engulfing candle at 111.700 and headed towards the South with good bearish momentum. It had a bounce at 107.000 and made an upward correction. The level of 109.185 has been working as a level of resistance. The price had a rejection at the level and produced a bearish inside bar. However, it has been heading towards the South again. Since yesterday’s candle came out as a strong bearish candle, the intraday sellers may want to go short until 107.000. The chart shows that the price has been heading towards the South with moderate bearish pressure. It has found its support at 107.500. The H4 sellers may wait for the price to go towards the upside and make a deeper consolidation. The level of 108.215 may work as a level of resistance. If the level produces a bearish reversal candle, the sellers may go short below the level of 107.500. The price may find its next support at 106.850. In case of a bullish breakout, the price may not produce good bullish momentum. It may get choppy instead. The chart shows that the price at its last bearish breakout made a long bearish move and found its support at 107.500. The level produced a bullish engulfing candle followed by another bullish one. Upon having a bearish correction, the price has been heading towards the North. It may find its resistance around 107.900. If the level produces a bearish reversal candle and drives the price towards the downside, the sellers may go short below 107.500. The price may find its next support at 107.000. In case of a bullish breakout, the buyers may push the price towards the level of 108.300 with moderate bullish momentum. The daily and the H4 charts are bearish biased, but the sellers are to wait. The H1 chart looks good for the sellers. Let us wait and see whether the pair produces another bearish candle depending on the H1 chart or produces a bullish corrective candle on the daily chart today.

5e95792da970ab0cb6a1a4a2	USD/IDR: Indonesian rupee tests monthly tops on Bank Indonesia’s status-quo	At its April monetary policy meeting held on Tuesday, Indonesia’s central bank, Bank Indonesia (BI), left its 7-day reverse repo rate unchanged at 4.50%, in line with expectations. The central bank kept maintained the status-quo after two back-to back rates cuts, as it looks to assess the impact of the previous cuts on the economy battling the coronavirus outbreak. Governor Warjiyo noted that there is room for further rate cuts. Liquidity more than adequate in banking system. Covid-19 epidemic will weaken demand for credit. Rate decision based on need to maintain stability. Will increase the intensity of 'triple intervention' to support rupiah. To increase liquidity through 'quantitative easing'. Cuts reserve requirement ratio. Reserve requirement ratio cut to release 102 trln rupiah to financial system. RRR to be cut by 200 bps for conventional banks, 50 bps for Islamic banks. Tweaks to rules on macroprudential intermediation ratio for Islamic banks to release 15.8 trln rupiah to market. New RRR effective May 1. Relaxes rules on late payment of credit cards. Monetary policy stance is loose. We decided not to utilise room for rate cut, taking into account market volatility. Raises macroprudential liquidity buffer ratio by 200 bps for conventional banks, 50 bps for Islamic banks. Orders banks to meet the new macroprudential liquidity buffer ratio by buying govt bond in primary market. On the Indonesian central bank’s expected rate cut outcome, the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) caught a fresh bid-wave against its American counterpart, knocking-off the USD/IDR pair back to test the four-week low of 15,630, where it now wavers.

5e8266be4e5aff1410f92736	Is China In Recovery?	In a few hours, China will release its “Official” NBS Manufacturing PMI data for March. The expectation is for a reading of 45, which is still in contraction territory. However, a print of 45 is much better than the previous reading of 35.7. A reading above 50 means the economy is in expansion and a reading below 50 means the economy is on contraction. In addition, the “Official” Non-Manufacturing PMI for March is also going to be released. There is not an estimate for this figure, however, the previous reading was 29.6. The reason I say “Official” is because this data is put out by the Chinese government. Depending on who you ask, these readings may or may not be as accurate as they could be. The more accurate data may come on Thursday, when the private company Caixin Global puts out its survey reading. Ironically, Caixin is expecting a reading of 45.8, slightly better than expectation on of the “Official” reading. Regardless, with coronavirus cases falling in China, and with factories and stores reopening, the number is likely to be better than last months. If the data is worse than expected, the U.S. dollar may continue to advance versus the Chinese Yuan. The USD/CNH had put in a high of 7.1959 on Sept. 3, 2019, and began forming a sideways channel, hitting a low 0f 6.8456 on Jan. 20. After breaking out of a descending wedge (and retesting the bottom of the channel on March 9), the pair shot higher back toward the top of the channel, and is currently consolidating in a pennant formation. Price consolidations in a pennant formation usually break out is the same direction of the previous move. Therefore, we should look for a breakout higher. Notice that as price reached the high of the pennant, the RSI was in overbought territory. This consolidation allowed for the RSI to move back within the neutral zone. On a 240-minute time frame we can get a better sense of support and resistance levels. First resistance is at today’s highs and the downward sloping trendline from the pennant near 7.1300. Above, there is the near-term high and top of the pennant at 7.1650. Finally, the all-time high from September is the third resistance level at 7.1854. First support is the upward sloping trendline from the bottom of the pennant near 7.07. Not far below that is the next level of horizontal support near 7.0571. Below there is the third level of support near the channel bottom at 6.9200. Whether or not the “Official” Manufacturing PMI and Non-Manufacturing PMI readings are real or not, the Caixin figures will matter more. And given the price formation at the moment, watch for USD/CNH to break higher out of the pennant (and note the target is way above near 7.38).	CNH
5e5d08dc73d82f5acc8afc95	Gold Under Pressure As Risk Sentiment Improves	On the economy Jerome Powell said that that he though the US economy was in a good place; he highlighted the strong labor market and consumer spending. He added that he could not see any reason why the current expansion of the US economy couldn’t continue, and that monetary policy was appropriate at its current level. His comments meant that near term expectations of a rate cut were slightly reduced, which would have added some pressure to non yielding gold. Powell undeterred by coronavirus However, possibly of more interest to goldbugs, was that Powell said that the outbreak of the virus has done little to alter the expected path of US interest rates. Whilst the Fed will keep an eye on the outbreak and its impact on the Chinese economy and the economies of its trading partners, the Fed doesn’t see it the baseline outlook of the US economy or interest rates changing. Risk appetite is also on the up on Wednesday as the number of new cases of coronavirus in the Hubei province, the worst affected area, was at the lowest level for a month. Additionally, top medical expert Zhong Nanshan has speculated that the virus could peak this month. The markets have responded optimistically. Riskier assets are back in favor whilst safe haven gold is declining. Gold Levels to watch On the hour hour chart, the uptrend in gold is still intact. There is trend line support at $1555-8 which coincides with the 200 sma. Immediate support can be seen at $1562 (today’s low) prior to $1558 (200 sma) and $1555 (trend line support). On the flipside a move above resistance at $1577 and $1580 could confirm the bullish trend remains intact.	USD
5e81ba3939c4304c7e8cff97	Sterling skids lower after UK ratings downgrade darkens outlook	LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling skidded lower against the dollar on Monday, as the greenback reasserted itself as a safe haven for investors amid the coronavirus pandemic and Britain’s economic outlook took another hit in the face of a credit ratings downgrade. The pound rose nearly 7 percent against the dollar last week as measures to inject liquidity into markets by the U.S. Federal Reserve and a $2 trillion stimulus bill passed by the U.S Congress cooled demand for the U.S. currency as a safe haven. Ratings agency Fitch cut Britain’s sovereign debt rating on Friday, saying the country’s debt levels would jump as the government ramped up its spending to offset the near shutdown of the economy in the face of the coronavirus. Facing what some economists say could be Britain’s deepest recession in a century after the government ordered many businesses to close to slow the spread of the virus, finance minister Rishi Sunak announced a string of stimulus measures to try to prevent a surge in unemployment. Central to Sunak’s plan is a commitment for the state to pay 80% of the wages of workers who are temporarily laid off. The Bank of England, like other central banks around the world, has also jumped into action, expanding its bond-buying programme by a record 200 billion pounds and cutting its main interest rate to a record low 0.1%. Fitch said the measures were necessary to cushion the economy but it now expected Britain’s public debt, as a share of gross domestic product, would rise to 94% in 2020 and 98% in 2021, from 84.5% in 2019. Doubts about Britain’s future trading ties with the European Union posed a further risk, Fitch said. By 0817 GMT, the pound was down 0.6% at $1.2360, off its highest levels since March 13. Against the euro, it was down 0.1% at 89.52 pence. “The fundamentals suggest sterling is vulnerable,” said Jane Foley, currency strategist at Rabobank in London, noting Britain’s current account deficit, Brexit, and the worsening of Britain’s public finances as dominating the fundamental outlook. “One of the interesting parts of the (Fitch) downgrade was pointing not just to the worsening of public finances but also the Brexit element, pointing to concerns about the UK’s trade agreement with the EU.” Foley also noted the sickness of Britain’s prime minister Boris Johnson, who has tested positive for coronavirus and shown symptoms, as being a negative for the pound.

5e74c5f8406a3d5998b2a413	GBP/USD: Elliott Wave Analysis And Forecast For 20/03/2020 – 27/03/2020	The pair GBP/USD remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a level of 1.2116. Main scenario: short positions will be relevant from corrections below the level of 1.2116 with a target of 1.2606 – 1.2508. Alternative scenario: breakout and consolidation above the level of 1.2116 will allow the pair to continue the rise up to the levels of 1.2520 – 1.3196. Analysis: Supposedly, the fifth wave of senior level V continues developing on the daily time frame, with a correction completed in the form of wave (2) of V inside. The third wave (3) of V is forming on the H4 time frame. Apparently, a descending impetus is forming as wave 3 of (3) on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to 1.1177 – 1.0687. The level of 1.2116 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2520 – 1.3196.	GBP
5e787c19c5b79c2222260d68	British Pound (GBP) Latest: GBP/USD, FTSE Struggle on Coronavirus Headline Fears	GBP/USD starts the week just above 1.1600, weighed down by increasing negative coronavirus headlines. The UK government has warned that a lockdown in London may be required to enforce social distancing requirements, and this seems highly likely now. Financial markets are taking little notice of the extreme central bank and government liquidity measures and instead are focusing on the daily coronavirus infection and fatality data. At the last count there were nearly 5,700 confirmed cases of the virus in the UK with 281 fatalities. The weekly GBP/USD chart shows little in the way of any support at the moment, while last week’s low print of 1.1412 – the lowest level since 1985 – stands out. GBP/USD did rally sharply last week to trade just below 1.2000 and another move like this cannot be ruled out entirely, especially with volatility at extreme levels. Trading headline risk is impossible, and traders need to carefully consider the risk/reward of any trade in the current environment.

5e94ff5e12e07d158482f2a3	When is China trade balance and how could it affect AUD/USD?	China’s General Administration of Customs is set to release the March month Trade Balance report sometime during mid-Asia this Tuesday. Forecasts suggest the headlines Trade Balance figures from $-7.09B to $18B. Further, the YoY Exports likely to bounce from -17.2% to -15% but Imports may drop to -8% from -4.0% previous readouts. Given the recent slew of positive surprises from China, trade numbers will be closely watched by the traders of the antipodeans as well as commodities. Ahead of the release, TD Securities said, We expect March exports and imports to drop by 14% y/y and 1% y/y, respectively. Re-opening of much of the Chinese industry will have helped to limit the decline in imports but actual manufacturing activity likely remained weak. Separately, exports will increasingly be weighed down by shutdowns in the RoW. Nonetheless, Chinese trade with Korea held up reasonably well over the month, indicating that March data will show improvement compared to Jan/Feb; Korean exports to China came in at 21.1% m/m, -5.8% y/y while imports were up 61.2% m/m, 1.6% y/y. Analysts at Westpac also mentioned, China’s March trade data will be worth watching. The median forecast is for a surplus of US$20bn, with a material contraction across both imports and exports. There is no fixed time but last month was 11 am local/1 pm Sydney. At the press time, the AUD/USD pair is seen extending gains to 0.6400 while benefitting from the recent US dollar weakness. While the recent pullback in the risk catalysts is also supportive of the price moves, positive surprises from China data could offer additional strength to the Aussie pair. Technically, the pair needs to provide a clear break above 50-day SMA level of 0.6375 to aim for February month low near 0.6425, until then chances of its pullback to the monthly rising trend line near 0.6235 can’t be ruled out. AUD/USD remains firm below 0.6400 with eyes on China trade data AUD/USD Forecast: Gold demand keeps boosting the Aussie The Trade Balance released by the General Administration of Customs of the People’s Republic of China is a balance between exports and imports of total goods and services. A positive value shows a trade surplus, while a negative value shows a trade deficit. It is an event that generates some volatility for the CNY. As the Chinese economy has an influence on the global economy, this economic indicator would have an impact on the Forex market. In general, a high reading is seen as positive (or bullish) CNY, while a low reading is seen as negative (or bearish) for the CNY.	AUD

5e69eb5fe234084680588ec6	Dollar skids as Trump's virus response disappoints	SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar slid in another seismic shift to price in more U.S. interest rate cuts on Thursday, as President Donald Trump sapped market confidence with a coronavirus plan light on details. The greenback dropped as far as 1% to 103.32 yen, fell as much as 0.6% to $1.1333 against the euro and lost 0.6% to the safe-haven Swiss franc. Riskier currencies were punished as the fearful mood sent the Australian dollar down 0.6% and the South Korean won skidding 1%, and losing even more ground to the rising yen. Trump announced on Wednesday a ban on travellers from 26 European countries entering the United States for a month. He unveiled economic steps to counter the virus but his address from the Oval Office was light on medical measures beyond assurances that “the virus has no chance against us”. “The market was looking for more,” said Moh Siong Sim, currency strategist at the Bank of Singapore. “A travel ban is part of the solution, but the more important parts are still missing. They are really the public health measures: Paid sick leave, free testing, free treatment,” he said. “The market is right now looking for perhaps more action from the Fed, given the disappointment from the White House.” Indeed, futures markets reacted swiftly. They are now pricing in the U.S. Federal Reserve moving the lower end of its benchmark funding band to zero when it meets next week. <0#FF:> “The deflationary shock that we had assumed would trigger a U.S. entry into the zero-yield world is turning out to be a combo of trade war, oil price war and COVID-19 virus,” J.P. Morgan’s long-term strategists Jan Loeys and Shiny Kundu said in a note. “(There are) close to even odds now of an official U.S. recession this year.” Trump’s address came with markets already in turmoil amid a string of increasingly dire news on the coronavirus. The longest bull run in U.S. stock market history has ended, with market talk that selling to cover margin calls was keeping gold and bonds from rallying. [.N] The World Health Organization overnight described the outbreak as a pandemic. Italy, where deaths rose by nearly a third overnight, has shuttered all shops except supermarkets, food stores and pharmacies. The yen was last up 0.8% on the greenback and soaring against other currencies, with gains around 1% on the Australian and New Zealand dollars and 2% on the won. Australia on Wednesday announced an $11.4 billion stimulus package including wage subsidies and cash payments to small businesses - though the Aussie slid further with the glum mood and growing recession fears. [AUD/] Investors are now waiting to see how aggressively the European Central Bank acts at its meeting later on Thursday. Traders expect a cut to the main deposit rate by 10 basis points. But it is no certainty since rates are already at a record-low -0.5% and further cuts could hurt bank margins and so squeeze lending. A press conference is due at 1230 GMT in Frankfurt, after the monetary policy meeting. The euro steadied around $1.1296 in the meantime. On Wednesday, the Bank of England slashed interest rates by 0.5 percentage point, though there are doubts the outsized move will be enough to fight the virus’ impact. The British pound last stood at $1.2803 , near this week’s low. “There’s a sense to which currency markets are going to reward the currencies of countries that are seen to be using whatever space they’ve got for easier fiscal and monetary policy,” said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB. “(But) even if the ECB wheel out a cocktail of lower rates, stepped up QE, more long-term ... in itself, that’s not going to inspire a huge amount of confidence that the eurozone economy is going to escape recession. The hope would be that we’ll have something more tangible on the fiscal side sooner rather than later.” Reporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Sam Holmes & Shri Navaratnam	USD

5e5d0926bd5d9d5ac0727657	AUD/USD Rate Rebound in Focus Ahead of RBA Minutes as RSI Recovers	AUD/USD appears to be stuck in a narrow range ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Minutes, but the exchange rate may extend the advance from the monthly low (0.6662) as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) recovers from oversold territory. The recent rebound in AUD/USDappears to have sputtered ahead of the monthly high (0.6774), and the exchange rate may face range-bound conditions over the coming days as the RBA appears to be in no rush to alter the forward guidance for monetary policy. The transcript from the first meeting for 2020 may highlight a wait-and-see approach as the “central scenario is for the Australian economy to grow by around 2¾ per cent this year and 3 per cent next year,” and the RBA may attempt to buy more time at its next meeting on March 3 amid“signs that the slowdown in global growth that started in 2018 is coming to an end.” In turn, the RBA Minutes may keep AUD/USD afloat as the central bank tames speculation for lower interest rates and emphasizes that “the easing of monetary policy last year is supporting employment and income growth in Australia and a return of inflation to the medium-term target range.” However, the coronavirus may become a growing concern for the RBA as China, Australia’s largest trading partner, struggles to contain the outbreak, and the central bank may come under pressure to further insulate the economy as Governor Philip Lowe and Co. insist that the board “remains prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed.” With that said, AUD/USD may face a more bearish fate over the coming months as the weakening outlook for the Asia/Pacific region raises the scope for a wider interest rate disparity between Australia and the US. Nevertheless, recent developments in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) warns of a larger rebound in AUD/USD as the oscillator recovers from oversold territory and carves a bullish formation.

5e71cd445d1d975c535fba1a	Yen firms in fresh flight to safety	SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen gained sharply, but the dollar held onto hefty overnight gains against other currencies on Wednesday, as fears over the coronavirus pandemic kept markets frazzled despite massive injections of liquidity by central banks. The yen rose 0.8% to 106.80 per dollar with a flight to safety in the Asia afternoon as stock markets around the region extended losses. [MKTS/GLOB] The pound and euro were ahead, but struggled to win back more than a fraction of the ground ceded to the dollar on Tuesday. The Aussie and kiwi languished below 60 cents. Markets have crumbled this month as investors liquidated nearly everything for cash - driving up the dollar’s value and the cost of borrowing the greenback abroad. “Funding strains are still there, and I think that is what’s spooking the market still,” said Moh Siong Sim, currency analyst at the Bank of Singapore. The world is adopting a war footing as the pandemic spreads and country after country announces draconian lockdowns. The virus has killed over 8,000 people globally, while the total number of cases is approaching 200,000, a Reuters tally shows. While crisis is also being met with massive fiscal and monetary policy measures, there are only tentative signs that it is working. The Bank of Japan on Tuesday made its biggest injection of dollar funds since 2008, helping to reduce the cost of dollars, relfected in cross-currency basis swap spreads. The spread on dollar/yen swaps narrowed to around -58 basis points from 120 basis points on Tuesday. Three-month euro/dollar cross-currency basis swap spreads had also fallen back overnight to 39 basis points from as high as 120 basis points. But it failed to improve market sentiment. “The newsflow is about as fluid as we have seen,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone. “It mirrors that of the (2008) financial crisis if not worse ... it’s very difficult to deal with this and I think FX traders don’t really know where to look at the moment.” The pound pared some gains to sit 0.4% higher at $1.2094 and the euro was steady at $1.1007. Export exposed currencies fared much worse. The Australian dollar has lost nearly 15% against the greenback this year and fell below 60 cents for the first time since 2003 overnight. It last stood at $0.5930, while the kiwi was $0.5942. Traders have also been watching volatility in the U.S. Treasury market to get a sense of the demand for dollars. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasuries soared 34 basis points overnight, the largest single-day rise since 2004. [US/] “It all stems from a shortage of US dollars,” said Gunter Seeger, senior vice president in investment-grade fixed income at New York asset manager PineBridge Investments. “People are very, very nervous,” Seeger said. “Everyone’s nervous about the virus, about oil prices, about their job, about everything.” Reporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Sam Holmes and Himani Sarkar	JPY
5e95f5542dd9500f6cffea78	GBP/USD hits fresh one-months highs above 1.2600	The GBP/USD pair printed a fresh one-month high during the American session at 1.2630. It then pulled back, finding support above 1.2600. As of writing, it trades at 1.2615, up more than a hundred pips for the day. Cable has risen in five out of the last six trading days boosted by a decline of the US dollar and also amid an improvement in market sentiment. Equity prices in Wall Street are higher following the first earnings reports and some optimism on the coronavirus outlook. The greenback is falling particularly against main European currencies and the yen. The DXY drops 0.35% and reached earlier the lowest levels since late March under 99.00. On the contrary, the pound is holding into recent gains after UK Primer Minister Johnson was discharged from hospital two days ago and also boosted by risk sentiment. The pound is also higher versus the euro on Tuesday, with EUR/GBP under 0.8700, at the lowest since March 10. The sterling has managed to extend the recovery versus the US dollar and also against the euro following February’s crash. GBP/USD is still below 1.2805 (January’s close), but it is substantially above the bottom near 1.1400 (March 20) while EUR/GBP is less than one hundred pips above the level it opened in March.	GBP
5e5d07c0203be655205b7ae4	Gold climbs to 7-yr high as virus woes boost safety demand	Gold prices rose to their highest level in seven-years on Thursday as investors sought safe haven assets after a rise in the number of new coronavirus cases in South Korea added to worries over the global economic impact of the outbreak. Spot gold was up 0.4% at $1,617.52 per ounce, its highest since Feb. 2013. U.S. gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,620.50. “As long as the coronavirus problem is in the headlines, gold prices will be very well supported at current levels, if the situation deteriorates prices can even go higher,” said SP Angel analyst Sergey Raevskiy. We were seeing some profit taking after the last run up in the prices, but overall the environment is very favorable for gold prices, he added. Even as the number of new coronavirus cases in China slowed, a spike in new infections and a first death in South Korea intensified fears that the disease could spread more widely. European shares eased from record highs after a raft of disappointing earnings and concerns over the impact of the virus weighed on sentiment. China cut the benchmark lending rate and banks in Shanghai have issued 1.31 billion yuan ($186.8 million) in cheap loans to 48 key firms to support an economy jolted by the crisis. The world’s second largest economy is likely to roll out more support measures, analysts said. U.S. Fed policymakers also acknowledged new risks caused by the epidemic, but were cautiously optimistic about their ability to hold interest rates steady this year, minutes of the central bank’s last policy meeting showed on Wednesday. “Gold is being driven chiefly by robust investment demand: gold ETFs registered inflows for the 21st day of trading in a row yesterday, and speculative financial investors are likely to have further expanded their net long positions as well,” Commerzbank analysts said in a note. Holdings of the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust, rose 0.2% to 931.60 tonnes on Wednesday, their highest since November 2016. On the technical front, ”$1,600 an ounce is a good support (for gold), while resistance lay at $1,613-$1,615,” said Afshin Nabavi, senior vice president at precious metals trader MKS SA. Elsewhere, palladium fell 0.8% to $2,691.85 an ounce, having touched a record high of $2,841.54 in the previous session on supply deficit concerns. Silver was steady at $18.40, while platinum slipped 0.7% to $998.50.	METAL
5e8c92b0aa0b401db9fa5f67	EUR/SEK Trades In A Descending Triangle	EUR/SEK traded somewhat lower today, but the slide stayed limited near the 200-EMA on the 4-hour chart, slightly above the lower bound of a descending triangle that’s been containing the price action since March 23rd. In theory, such triangles are considered bearish, but bearing in mind that, in reality, we saw such patterns being exited to the upside, we will hold a neutral stance for now and wait for the rate to break out, in either direction. A break of the triangle’s lower end, which coincides with the 10.850 zone, would confirm a forthcoming lower low and may encourage the bears to push towards the 10.700 territory, fractionally above the inside swing highs of January 31st and February 3rd, as well as near the low of March 11th. Another break below 10.700 could extend the slide towards the low of March 9th, at around 10.630. Turning attention to our short-term momentum studies, we see that the RSI runs below 50, while the MACD lies below both its zero and trigger lines. Both indicators detect downside speed, but the RSI has just ticked up, which supports our view to wait for a dip below 10.850 before getting confident on larger bearish extensions. On the upside, we would like to see a decisive break above 11.020, before we start examining whether the bulls have stolen the bears’ weapons. Such a move may confirm the break of the triangle’s upper side and may initially pave the way towards the high of March 30th, at 11.110, where another break may carry more bullish implications, perhaps setting the stage for the peak of March 23rd, at around 11.200.

5e81b56cc496d2354de72fb5	Dollar on Backfoot as US Data Disappoints	The US dollar is sensitive to data misses and even though the ISM services PMI remains in expansion territory, the lower than expected index triggered a sell off of the greenback. The United States is not immune to recession fears even if it remains the developed economy with the strongest pace of growth, but the prolonged trade war with China and the ease to launch tariffs is beginning to have lasting effects on the US economy. The two PMI releases of US data this week came in lower than forecasted and will put pressure on the Fed to lower the benchmark rate when they meet at the end of the month. The US dollar defied expectations and rose through geopolitical uncertainty at home as Democrats launched an investigation on President Trump as the US re-opened the trade war front with Europe after the WTO gave green light to tariff retaliation linked to aircraft subsidies. The signs of an economic slowdown in the US will be hard to ignore for the hawkish Fed, but it will have to concede that more stimulus is needed. The minutes from the September FOMC meeting will be released on Wednesday, October 9 and will be full of insight into the central bank’s view on the US economy and why it remained hawkish. The stock market is rising as the PMIs are giving a strong dovish signal that could force the Fed to admit the two rate cuts this year, and more to come are not a mid-cycle adjustment but the start of an easing cycle. Euro Advances as Data Misses Sink Dollar The EUR/USD gained 0.37 percent in the last five trading sessions and is trading at 1.0982 ahead of the end of the week. The single currency lost ground as the US published its employment data as even with a lower than expected 130,000 jobs created in September it was still a solid number. The events of the week caught up with the dollar in the middle of the Friday session. Lower PMIs during the week, uncertainty rising in Washington ahead of the US-China trade talks and new tariffs on European goods led to the dollar depreciating against the euro. The economic calendar for next week offers less economic indicators, but risk events will offer plenty of volatility, with China coming back online after celebrating its anniversary, Brexit and US political drama to serve as backdrop for inflation data and the minutes from the FOMC meeting The two main drivers for the US dollar will be incremental updates in the US-China Trade War and if US economic data deteriorates even further. Early on the focus will be what will come out of the high-level trade talks. Talks resume on October 10-11 in Washington DC. We could see extreme volatility on any speculation with this latest round of talks. A continuing trend of softer US data has market expectations surging that the Fed will deliver a third consecutive rate cut at the October 30th meeting and possibly a fourth one in December. The Fed’s Minutes will be released on Wednesday, but we will likely see the markets more focused on Powell’s latest comments which will occur both on Tuesday and Wednesday. We will also hear from Kashkari on Tuesday, Mesters on Thursday, and Kashkari, Rosengren and Kaplan on Friday. On Thursday the release of US inflation data will look to see if it can complicate the Fed’s job. Despite a record expansion, the US has not seen inflation rise above the Fed’s target. Hotter numbers however may help the Fed argue that they can’t go full dove. On Friday, the confidence figures from the University of Michigan will closely be watched. A wrath of softer confidence numbers will likely cement in growing bets that the Fed will be capitulating in delivering an easing cycle. Bond yield volatility should continue and we could see that be the case for the rest of the month. If yields continue to plummet the dollar could finally see a significant reversal. Even if we see a positive outcome from the latest round of trade talks, the Fed should still be good for a couple more rate cuts as they will look to keep the record long expansion going. Regardless of an interim trade deal, the Fed will need to deliver a stronger dovish message as business confidence will remain vulnerable and inflation is subdued. BITCOIN Bitcoin has settled around $8,000 after slipping below $9,000 and tumbling in the days that followed. As always, it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly what has got bitcoin traders excited but the recent sell-off highlights how sensitive and volatile it remains. OIL Oil prices are vulnerable to various factors, most notably at the moment global growth fears. Traders have quickly shaken off the Saudi attacks, worryingly leaving no risk-premium in the price. This may come back to bite them. Growth fears continue to act as a drag on oil prices though although they are now trading around 2019 lows where prices have repeatedly found support. If this breaks, it could trigger a sharp decline in crude. With sentiment so fragile right now, oil is sensitive to weaker data points, particularly from the US. It’s gone quiet on the Saudi front but further flare ups are always likely, it’s a case of when rather than if and we’ve seen what impact the attack had. Each event is more serious than the last. GOLD Gold has been given a lift this week by the flurry for traditional safe havens in the wake of some weak data points from the US, with both the ISM manufacturing and services numbers adding to the recession fears that have lingered over the last quarter. This rally though came after gold finally broke below $1,480 which had held for some time and so it remains near-term bearish unless we see a break above $1,535. Market sentiment is very fragile after this week and the jobs report on Friday may add to this. Gold, as ever, will remain sensitive to swings in sentiment. USD/MXN MEXICAN PESO The Mexican currency is a perfect proxy for investment into Latin America. The currency appreciated rapidly as the ISM non-manufacturing PMI disappointed and sapped the momentum away from the US dollar. The MXN erased all the loses for the week and awaits the US NFP report to confirm a trifecta of negative economic indicators. US-China trade negotiations are no hold as China celebrates its anniversary. BREXIT Boris Johnson’s Brexit proposal has been met with a warmer reception that any backstop alternative that we’ve seen in the past. This has given hope to the prospect of a deal but that will be extremely hard to achieve by the end of October. There is going to need to be compromise on both sides, with the UK likely needing to compromise on the 31 October deadline. Talks will continue but we have entered into serious negotiations, with only two weeks to go until the EU summit when all must (apparently) be signed off. These deadlines have been breached in the past though. Sterling continues to show its sensitivity to these negotiations in both directions. If it appears that Boris is closing on a deal, significant upside lies ahead. The opposite is also likely true in the event of a no-deal and it will be extremely volatile in the interim with constant commentary appearing throughout the day. WASHINGTON The impeachment process will be lengthy and ultimately see President Trump remain in office. Wall Street seems to be getting more nervous that the Democratic nomination will now go to Elizabeth Warren. With Bernie Sander’s health now in question, it seems that the 78-year old senator may have to put his Presidential bid on hold. If Elizabeth Warren becomes the favorite for becoming the next President, we could see that derail the bullish case for a much higher stock market in 2020.

5e5d086673d82f5acc8afc62	Oil At 13 Month Low, More Downside To Come?	API data API reported a smaller than forecast inventory build of 1.3 million barrels, versus expectations of a 3-million-barrel increase. Today’s EIA weekly inventories report is expected to show a build of 2.3 million barrels. As coronavirus panic takes over, traders are become increasing more concerned with how global oil demand will be hit and less interested in weekly inventory data. There seems to be little interest in the steep decline in Libyan output or whether the OPEC+ group decides to trim production again. OPEC It is doubtful that OPEC+ will announce further output cuts right now, without having further information on loss of demand. There is a good chance that they will wait for fresh economic data to assess the impact of coronavirus first. Even if OPEC did announce additional production cuts, we are more likely to see some short covering now rather than a change of trend. Levels to watch Crude is down 1.7% today and almost 8% so far this week. Crude trades at a 13-month low and below its 50, 100 and 200 moving average, with a bearish outlook. Immediate support can be seen at $49 (today’s low), a break through here could open the door to $48.30 (8th Jan ‘19 low) prior to $46.70 (4th Jan’19 low). Resistance csan be seen at $50.42 (today’s high). This could lead towards resistance at $52. (yesterday’s high), a breakthrough there could negate the current bearish trend.	ENERGY
5e5d31c7d3c8fc0aa1ab81e4	EUR/USD Sets It's Sights On $1.0970 Resistance	EUR/USD is approaching $1.0950, a 2-week high in its 5th straight bullish session. Whilst coronavirus fears are dragging on the greenback, hopes of stimulus in Germany are boosting the euro. Eurozone business confidence data was better than expected, underpinning the euro. Like PMIs, German IFO index, the European Commission ‘s economic indicator also improved in February, gaining for a 4th straight month. The manufacturing sector showed a healthy increase in confidence for a 2nd straight month thanks to improving order books. However, before we get too carried away on the prospect of a recovery in the manufacturing sector, the survey was conducted in the first 2 / 3 weeks of the month before the coronavirus outbreak in Italy and before numbers in China really started to take off. GDP is expected to confirm 2.1% growth annually in Q4. Durable goods are expected to show -1.5% decline in January. Despite trading 0.7% higher today and gaining over 1% so far this week, the EUR/USD downtrend on the 4-hour chart remains intact. The price would need to push beyond resistance at $1.0970 (trend line and 200 sma) to negate the current bearish trend. Failure to break above $1.0970 resistance could send the pair back toward support at $1.0780 (low Feb. 20).	USD
5e665bd4117c4a0b57287cbd	EUR/USD Trading Strategies: What To Watch Today	The daily chart of the EUR/USD Forex market has broken far above the 18-month bear channel. Since the 3-week rally has had at least 3 surges, it is a parabolic wedge buy climax. That typically attracts profit-taking, but there is no top yet. Traders will buy the 1st pullback. But after such an extreme buy climax, the next leg up might only last a day or two. Traders should expect some sustained profit taking for a week or two beginning this week. As I wrote over the weekend, the 2-year bear trend has probably ended. The EURUSD rally might be the resumption of the 2017 bull trend. However, the 2-year bear trend was a Spike and Channel pattern. There is typically a rally that tests the start of the bear channel and then the chart evolves into a trading range. That is what is likely here. The EURUSD Forex market will probably be in a trading range from 1.08 to 1.18 for the next year. The 5-minute chart of the {{0 EUR/USD} Forex market has been sideways overnight. There is a triangle on the 60-minute chart. A triangle in a strong bull trend is a bull flag. But it is also a good candidate for the Final Bull Flag. If there is a bear breakout, a 1 – 2-week pullback will probably begin. If instead there is a bull breakout, it will probably fail within a few days. The {{0 EUR/USD} will then typically get drawn back to the triangle. It will then probably trade sideways to down for a couple of weeks. Since it has been in a triangle overnight, day traders are buying low, selling high, and scalping. The legs are big and scalps have been 20 – 40 pips. If the {{0 EUR/USD} continues sideways, the move will get smaller. A triangle is a Breakout Mode pattern. There is, therefore, an increased chance of a breakout up or down and then a trend day.	USD
5e7a2a8d0047e02db43dd5a0	AUD/USD, NZD/USD Daily Forecast - March 24, 2020	AUD/USD more stable in line with other markets & therefore I think we want to switch to more of a scalping/range trading strategy….being mindful of the potential for further downside moves should further shocks arise. NZD/USD held first support at 5650/00 perfectly for a bounce to our first target of 5790/5810 (as I write) as we range trade as predicted. Hopefully you bagged around 150 pips! Reports will be updated around lunch time GMT if necessary. AUD/USD tests resistance at 5880/5920 but could continue higher today to retest the last short term swing high at 5965/85. Try shorts with stops above 6010. A break higher targets 6030 then strong resistance at 6080/6100. Shorts at 5965/85 target 5900 & 5840, perhaps as far as support at 5820/10. A break below targets 5790 then 5750 before strong support at late 2002 highs of 5688/78. Longs need stops below 5650. Next targets are 5600/5580, 5550/40, 5500/5480. NZD/USD holding above first support at 5740/30 (which is 1 week descending trend line) targets only minor resistance at 5790/5810 (& we topped exactly here over night). A break higher targets 5840/50 before stronger resistance at recent swing highs at 5880/5915. Try shorts with stops above 5940. Longs at first support at 5740/30 need stops below 5700 which risks a slide to 5635/00 before the short term range low of 5610/5590. A break lower targets 5550/30 before strong support at 5490/70 low. A break lower targets 5450/40, 5360/40, 5300/5280, 5220/5200 & 5130/10.

5e74c5f8406a3d5998b2a412	USD/JPY: Elliott Wave Analysis And Forecast For 20/03/2020 – 27/03/2020	The pair USD/JPY is still likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a level of 112.24. Main scenario: short positions should be considered from corrections below the level of 112.24 with a target of 98.73 – 94.71. Alternative scenario: breakout and consolidation above the level of 112.24 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 114.53 – 118.00. Analysis: On the daily time frame, supposedly, a big horizontal correction finished forming as a triangle-shaped wave (В) of B. On the H4 time frame, wave E of (B) finished forming and wave (С) of B started developing, with the first wave i of 1 of (C) formed inside. Apparently, a local correction is nearing completion in the form of wave ii of 1 of (C) on the H1 time frame. If the presumption is correct, the pair may be expected to fall to the levels of 98.73 – 94.71. The level of 112.24 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue growing to the levels of 114.53 – 118.00	JPY
5e5d07bc203be655205b7ad5	Chinese stocks up more than 2%, rest of Asia mixed as investors assess coronavirus impact	Asia Pacific markets traded mixed on Monday as investors continued to assess the potential economic fallout from the pneumonia-like coronavirus that’s infected more than 70,000 people and killed over 1,700. Chinese shares on the mainland rose: The Shanghai composite rose 2.28% to 2,983.62, the Shenzhen composite was up 3.18% to 1,835.96 and the Shenzhen component added 2.98% to 11,241.50. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 0.58% in late afternoon trade. In an effort to alleviate the shock of the virus outbreak on businesses, China is planning targeted tax cuts while increasing government spending, Finance Minister Liu Kun wrote Sunday in China’s Communist Party magazine Qiushi. The Ministry of Finance said Saturday it would provide 8 billion yuan in a second round of support for virus prevention and control efforts. As of Friday, all levels of finance ministries in China had allocated 90.15 billion yuan in support, according to the central government. Economists expect the People’s Bank of China to step up its liquidity measures to ease funding conditions in Chinese money markets to combat downside risks posed by the infection. “Admittedly, while lots of fluids is a recommendation for flu, money market liquidity infusions alone will not address China’s woes from the coronavirus,” Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy for Asia at Mizuho Bank, wrote in a note. “Nonetheless, ensuring ease of cash flow is a necessary condition to ensure otherwise viable businesses do not go belly up due to a seizure in liquidity,” Varathan said, adding that he thought the PBOC would “more than offset upcoming liquidity drainage.” Read: Coronavirus live updates — China reports 105 additional deaths, 2,048 new cases Elsewhere, Japanese shares fell, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 down 0.69% to 23,523.24 and the Topix index off by 0.89% to 1,687.77.

In Australia, the ASX 200 closed fractionally lower at 7,125.10, as the heavily weighted financial subindex declined 0.44%. South Korea’s Kospi index declined 0.06% to 2,242.17. Singapore’s Straits Times index was down 0.23% as of 3:48 p.m. HK/SIN, after the city-state downgraded its 2020 economic forecast. Singapore is grappling with one of the highest numbers of coronavirus cases outside China. “The worrying human and economic toll of the COVID-19 outbreak is creating much uncertainty, especially as changes to the case tracking methods are making news difficult to interpret,” John Bromhead from ANZ Research wrote in a morning note. “Markets appear to be expecting a short-lived economic impact, but they are in “wait-and-see” mode,” Bromhead said, explaining that although Chinese factories are slowly re-opening after being shut over an extended period of time after the Lunar New Year break, it will take time to clear the backlog of cargo at ports. Significant disruption is also ongoing, he added. The virus, which was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, is expected to have a significant economic impact on China as well as the global economy. Officials disclosed on Saturday that travel during the latest Lunar New Year period was a fraction of previous years amid increased travel restrictions aimed at containing the virus’ spread. People stayed home and took advantage of refund policies that authorities enacted — China’s aviation authority said since it first announced a ticket refund policy in late January, domestic and foreign airlines have processed 20 million in tickets worth more than 20 billion yuan ($2.9 billion). The number of flights has been about a quarter of what it was last year, a representative said. China’s railway authority said rail trips during the holiday travel period so far has been one-seventh of the 280 million it had anticipated, and that it has processed 11.5 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) in ticket refunds.

5e94696229a52c07d0f1767b	Saudi energy minister: Could cut output below current quota of 8.5 million bpd if needed	"The effective oil supply cuts by OPEC+, G20 nations and SPR purchases will account to about 19.5 billion barrels per day (bpd) in total global reductions, Saudi Arabia's energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told reporters on Monday. ""Oil purchases into reserves seen at 200 million barrels over the next couple of months would contribute towards effective output cuts,"" bin Salman added. ""Saudi Arabia could cut oil output below the current quota of 8.5 million bpd if there was a need by market and if reductions are done collectively with others on a pro-rata basis."" The minister further noted that the Kingdom is not delaying its plans to raise the oil output capacity to 13 million bpd post OPEC+ cut pact. Crude oil prices edged higher on these comments and the barrel of West Texas Intermediate was last seen trading at $23.40, adding 1% on a daily basis."	USD
5e95e9aa47702a5327abe59e	The great run of the S&P 500 bulls	Sunday’s special Stock Trading Alert laid out the coronavirus crisis, response and consequences ahead in great detail and a 360-degrees view. Reading it will help you get the most out of today’s article as we will look at the internals and prospects of the stock market advance, and also introduce parallels relevant to today. Let’s get right into yesterday’s price action in S&P 500 (charts courtesy of http://stockcharts.com). Despite the intraday downswing and bearish opening gap, stocks didn’t decline and bring the evening star formation into existence. But that doesn’t mean the bulls are out of the woods now. There are several cautionary signs such as decreasing volume, the tired look of the daily indicators, and inability to overcome the 50% retracement of the slide that took stocks from their all-time mid-Feb highs down to the mid-March panic lows. Additionally, several bearish gaps such as the one right above the 50% Fibonacci retracement or higher, stand unchallenged. Let’s bring up the below chart with the relevant analysis from today’s Gold & Silver Trading Alert: (…) Stocks didn’t decline after opening with a price gap yesterday, which means that the “evening star” formation wasn’t completed. However, this doesn’t mean that the situation is now bullish. Conversely, what we see now resembles the previous biggest correction during this downswing – the one that we saw in early March. It started with a relatively low volume and during the daily downswing. That’s also what we saw yesterday. Of course, the above is not the key detail factor behind the upcoming decline – fear in general and closing down a large part of the world for many weeks, along with broken supply chains, is the key detail. The above simply provides a timing indication. It’s certainly true that quite a few tradable, sizable market moves start with a fake run in the opposite direction that ultimately burns itself out and reverses course. And this is what we’re likely witnessing these days in stocks as well. A careful look reveals that stocks have been trading in a short-term rising wedge recently. Yesterday’s candle represents a test of the bulls’ resolve. While they may and likely will push higher again, it’s probable they’ll meet with increasing involvement of the bears. Regardless of the backing-and-filling that may come over the nearest days, another leg lower will come as surely as an increase in selling pressure. Having said that, let’s examine two debt market charts – first, the newly supported HYG ETF, and then its ratio to short-dated Treasuries. High-yield corporate debt couldn’t add to its Thursday’s gains yesterday. Whether or not it’s consolidating its meteoric gains, will help determine the fate of stocks’ short-term rally. Should it be the case, then the ratio of these corporate junk bonds to the highest market cap short-term Treasuries ETF would be expected to rise as the bullish juices return to the stock market. We mean true bullish sentiment, not a reflexive rally originating in new money thrown at the issues that bring less bang for the buck than the previous stimulus did. Yesterday, the ratio didn’t really shine all too brightly. That’s a leading indicator for stocks, which makes it understandable that the S&P 500 is lagging in the veracity of its $2.3T package rally. There’s one more anecdotal evidence why something doesn’t feel right about the upswing. The below screenshot comes from Jim Cramer’s Mad Money show. While markets are forward-looking, anticipating and discounting mechanisms, something stinks here. Can a true market recovery take hold when the real economy is going downhill this steeply? As we’ve discussed at length in our Sunday’s Stock Trading Alert, the case for a new leg lower and worsening coronavirus fallout, is strong. Stocks definitely appear to be getting ahead of themselves in anticipation of the V-shaped recovery, regardless of their underperformance of the debt markets. Similarly sharp rallies have been what has punctured the way to the S&P 500 Great Depression lows. There have been quite a few false dawns since stocks succumbed to the big bear of late 1920s. And even the on-screen number of 1938 brings up another historic parallel. One of the most memorable and also sizable stock drops came with the defeat of France in 1940. Facing Dunkerque, it became clear that prevailing over Nazi Germany wouldn’t be fast. Similar recognition will strike the markets in the coming days and weeks, as the economic costs of the coronavirus fallout both so far and still to come, become reflected in stock prices. The potential for policy missteps remains high, but the Fed has been doing a good job at limiting the financial system damage, and has actually instilled a degree of confidence. While the Fed projects the power to stave off depression, they cannot buy us a true recovery. And that’s why we expect another leg lower in the coming days and weeks. Base-building is a process and while today’s bullish gap coupled with the sharp advance over 2800 shortly after today’s market open may appear encouraging, it works to lure the bulls into the market at a time when the risk-reward ratio isn’t really on their side. Summing up, the bulls again seized the short-term momentum, and the credit markets appear to be giving them the benefit of the doubt. While the short-term bottom is in, the nearest key resistance (the 50% Fibonacci retracement) remains unbeaten. The risk-reward ratio isn’t on the bulls’ side as the market needs to somehow digest recent gains. In such an environment, sideways trading followed by renewed selling pressure taking on the March lows, is an optimistic scenario. The medium-term outlook remains bearish, and the short position justified as stocks won’t likely shrug off weak incoming April and May data on retail sales, consumer confidence, employment, manufacturing or the GDP.

5e68d470f224c4013ca885c6	Sterling bounces on Bank of England emergency rate cut	LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling climbed against the dollar and recovered from an initial tumble versus the euro on Wednesday after the Bank of England become the second major central bank to slash interest rates in an emergency response to the coronavirus. The move, which chopped half a percentage point off the benchmark lending rate, taking it back to a record low 0.25%, came just hours before the government sets out its budget plans. It was the BoE’s first out-of-schedule cut since the global financial crisis in 2008. Many London traders were still getting to their desks when the announcement came and sterling remained choppy as outgoing BoE Governor Mark Carney and his successor Andrew Bailey detailed what they called a “big package” from the bank. A spurt of buying sent the pound up as much 0.7% to $1.2962 on the dollar though it seemed to want to go in circles versus the euro, from as low as 88.40 pence per euro straight after the cut to as high as 87.13 pence at its peak. “We saw an immediate reaction” said Jane Foley a senior currency strategist at Rabobank. “The 50 basis point move was on the aggressive side of expectations and it was a bit of a surprise that they went before the budget. “But it is in some way reassuring that the BoE say they have been coordinating with the Treasury, and the fact that UK authorities have prepared a comprehensive package of measures.” As well as the rate cut, the BoE said it would allow banks to release a special store of capital, known as the counter-cyclical capital buffer, so they can continue lending to households and businesses during the coronavirus epidemic. Finance minister Rishi Sunak is due to present his first budget shortly after 1230 GMT, which is expected to include more healthcare funding to fight the coronavirus, as well as further economic stimulus. The U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada both lowered rates last week although the BoC’s move was at a planned meeting. The European Central Bank is expected to take action on Thursday. “There was no reason for this shock to turn into the experience of 2008 ... if we handle it well,” Carney said, referring to the financial crisis. Sterling’s firmness dovetailed with a 5 basis point rise in benchmark 10-year Gilt yields, which are a broad proxy for British government borrowing costs. The currency is down roughly 5% against the dollar since a general election in December ended a deadlock over Brexit, although it had been clawing back ground until this week. Against the euro, it has dropped almost 6% over the last month. “This is better package than we have had elsewhere (due to the range of measures),” Saxo Bank’s head of European FX strategy John Hardy said of the BoE’s move. The key now was if banks in the UK pick up the incentive to provide credit to firms or households or whether a bigger fiscal package was needed, he added. On a wider level, Hardy said: “It is still yet to dawn on markets how quickly policymakers are going to have to get up to a gallop to get on top of this.” Reporting by Marc Jones, Editing by Joice Alves and Catherine Evans	GBP
5e81b610c496d2354de73041	Dollar’s next move depends on Trump’s trade progress and border wall funding concession	The relief rally in equities appears to have run out of steam as risk aversion gained momentum on concerns trade talks are not progressing fast enough and global growth fails to show signs of stabilization, despite accommodative stances globally. The US dollar and Japanese yen could continue to see gains if the political risks yield no progress and the economic backdrop continues to diminish. Next week the focus will remain on trade talks, Brexit, corporate earnings and if we will see another government shutdown. If US negotiators do not deliver a more optimistic tone on the trade front early in the week, we could see risk aversion accelerate. The Republicans and Democrats do not want to see another shutdown and talks appear to have been constructive this week. Even if both parties agree on a deal, uncertainty lies with the President, since it is unknown if he would accept funding of just north of $2 billion for his border wall funding, well shy of his heavily demanded $5.7 billion. • US negotiators head to Beijing to resume trade talks & another government shutdown looms • Brexit deadline nears; concessions unlikely ahead of Parliament vote on amendments • US inflation to continue to soften could raise rate cut expectations USD King dollar is back, as the Treasury yield curve steadily declined in a week that was filled with fading optimism we will see clear signals that trade talks are nearing a framework deal and on global growth slowdown concerns. The dollar was stronger against all of its major trading partners with the exception of the Japanese yen as risk aversion remained the dominant theme. High-beta currencies remain vulnerable, despite last month’s clear dovish pivot by the Fed, as accommodative stances were signaled by RBA and BOE this week, joining the likes of the ECB, RNBZ and PBOC. Stocks US stocks seem to lack direction, despite accommodative stances signaled across the board by all the major economies, as uncertainty remains high on both global growth concerns and the trade front. Key deadlines on trade are nearing; On February 17th a report is due from Commerce Department on potential tariffs on European autos and the March 1st deadline for China to deliver enough concessions to the US to avoid an increase in tariffs from 10% to 25%. Stocks pared losses on Friday after some positive corporate earnings, but will unlikely see the remaining companies due to report deliver another major move higher. Until the markets see clarity and substantial progress on political risks on Brexit, the trade war between China and the US, the brewing one with the US and Europe, and the government shutdown, it will be difficult for stocks to make a run towards last year’s highs. Brexit With seven weeks left until the UK’s exit from the EU, the base case for Brexit remains that it will be extended. Thursday’s talks with the EU did not deliver any concessions but signalled they will remain open and likely come to a head later in the month. Next week, PM May will need to deliver a revised deal in the House of Commons on February 13th and Parliament will vote on amendments the next day. Brussels is starting to worry they are going to get blamed if we see a no-deal Brexit, but is unlikely to compromise on the backstop or offer up any significant concessions to PM May. Oil West Texas Intermediate crude’s biggest weekly loss since December came as oil drillers ramped up drilling for the second time this year and US is speaking directly to Venezuela’s military insisting they abandon support for Maduro. Working American oil rigs rose 0.8% to 854 rigs this week, a sign that producers are becoming more optimistic as oil prices remain well off the December lows. Increased US production and a positive resolution in Venezuela, alongside with the ending of sanctions could however spur significant downward pressure for oil prices. Bitcoin Securities and Exchange Commissioner Robert Jackson may have thrown Bitcoin a lifeline that may have squeezed out shorts and prevented a collapse below the heavily watched $3,000 level. The commissioner expressed optimism that he eventually could see a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund gain approval from the SEC. While the hurdles for a crypto exchange-traded fund are immense, today’s headlines just squeezed out shorts and may not reflect the optimism of any significant progress forward. The security risks are too great and despite the fall in volatility, we could see this rally find key resistance from the $4,000 level.

5e5d08dc73d82f5acc8afc99	EUR/CHF – It’s All about the RSI	Yes, it’s true the EUR/USD has had six straight down days entering today. However, just because the EUR/USD has been moving lower lately, it does not justify the move lower in EUR/CHF, which has been moving lower since late October! But is it time for the pair to bounce? When we look at the EUR/CHF across multiple timeframes, they all seem to have one thing in common, the RSI is diverging with price! According to Investopedia, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the prices of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator and can have a reading from 0 to 100. An RSI with a value above 70 is considered overbought and a reading of below 30 indicates oversold. A bullish divergence occurs when the RSI creates an oversold reading followed by a higher low that matches correspondingly lower lows in price. A bearish divergence occurs when the RSI creates an overbought reading, followed by a lower high that matches correspondingly higher highs in price. On a weekly timeframe, EUR/CHF has been moving lower in earnest since mid-May 2018. Price is currently at 1.0670, very close to the 61.8% retracement level from the January 2015 lows (when the SNB pulled the 1.2000 EUR/CHF peg) to the May 2018 highs, which also represents horizontal support. Price has filled the gap from mid-April 2017. Notice how the RSI is diverging from price. Price is making a lower low and the RSI is making a higher low, which is a bullish divergence: Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com On a daily timeframe, one only needs to go back to January 24th to see the divergence. Price is putting in lower lows as the RSI is putting in higher lows (a bullish divergence): Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Even on a 240-minute timeframe, one only needs to go back to January 28th to see that the RSI and price are diverging (bullish divergence): Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com What does it mean when price is diverging with the RSI? This is an indication that there may be price reversal ahead shortly. However, when divergences occur across multiple timeframes, it provides stronger support to the theory that a price reversal may be ahead. In addition, when you add in other technical indicators, such as the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, the horizontal support, and the gap fill on the weekly, it provides a stronger narrative due to a confluence of supports. Will EUR/CHF reverse here? Nothing is certain. But the idea is to try and determine a confluence of many indicators (both technical and fundamental). This will increase the odds of the trade working out in your favor. When there are diverging RSIs with price, across multiple timeframes, odds increase of a reversal in price.	CHF
5e958a99d8f66e66cdeb366a	WTI off eight-day lows, still in the red around $22 ahead of API	WTI (oil futures on NYMEX) extends its bearish momentum into a third day on Tuesday, having posted a new eight-day low at 21.70 in the last hour. At the time of writing, the US oil has managed to regain the 22 handle, still shedding 1.50% on a daily basis. The black gold rallied to near 23.10 region in early Asia, mainly driven by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) prediction that shale output in the world’s biggest crude producer would fall by a record amount in April. Meanwhile, upbeat Chinese trade data also lifted the mood and kept the prices at higher levels before concerns over the oil demand growth outlook resurfaced, as the coronavirus crisis is a long way to go. China’s crude oil imports in March rose by 4.5% YoY, as reported by the China Customs. Also, the barrel of WTI looks vulnerable as oil traders were somewhat let down by the OPEC+ output cut deal reached on Sunday, despite the output cuts being equal to about 10% of global supply before the viral outbreak. The OPEC and non-OPEC producers (OPEC+), finally, agreed over Easter to cut output by 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in May and June. Along with the US and other countries, the total estimates output cut is about 19.5 billion bpd. Markets now look forward to the US crude supplies report due to be published by the American Petroleum Institute (API) later today at 2030 GMT for near-term trading opportunities. In the meantime, broad-based US dollar weakness could help cushion the downside in the USD-sensitive oil.	ENERGY
5e79d00e95ef6c182930a590	Dollar falls for a second day on Fed stimulus	LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar slipped for a second consecutive day on Tuesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve unveiled fresh measures to supply precious liquidity into funding markets, sending risky currencies such as the Australian dollar soaring. The Fed announced unlimited quantitative easing and programs to support credit markets on Monday in a drastic bid to backstop an economy reeling from emergency restrictions on commerce to fight the coronavirus. Against a basket of its rivals =USD, the dollar fell 0.5% to 101.52, down more than 1% from Monday’s highs and having hit a more than three-year high of 102.99 on Friday. “The dollar funding conditions are easing slightly compared with a week ago, though I wouldn’t say things are normal. While the Fed is pumping dollars, we still need to wait and see if that money will flow to every corner of the economy,” said Koichi Kobayashi, chief manager of forex at Mitsubishi Trust Bank. While the Fed’s latest measures were seen to have effectively broken the spreading freeze in the dollar funding markets in the short-term, the shock to the real economy is expected to last for a far longer period with latest PMI data offering a glimpse of the pain. Japan posted its biggest ever services sector decline and factory activity shrank at its fastest in a decade, consistent with a 4% economic contraction this year. The picture in Australia was similar. Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX and commodity research at Commerzbank said in a note that as more economies enact draconian measures to lock down their economies, the global economy would be massively constrained in the near future and markets could quickly turn back into risk-off mode. But in early London trading, battered currencies rallied. The euro gained 1% to $1.0834 EUR=EBS, bouncing back from a near three-year low of $1.0636 in the previous session. The British pound also rose 0.9% to $1.1650 GBP=D3, up more than two cents from its 35-year low of $1.1413 set last week. The Fed announced various programs including purchases of corporate bonds, guarantees for direct loans to companies and a plan to get credit to small and medium-sized business. Trading remained volatile, with the Australian dollar rising 2.0% to $0.5952 AUD=D3, extending its recovery from a 17-year low of $0.5510 touched last week.

5e795a1790b1e95b418b32dc	The US dollar will test 105 against a basket of currencies in the short term, analyst says	World markets are facing a simple but serious problem: There just aren’t enough dollars to execute trades and transactions. That explains why the trade-weighted dollar index, gained more than 4% last week. The broad dollar index measures the value of the dollar against a basket of currencies, namely the euro, pound, yen, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc and Swedish krona. Given the scarcity of dollars, the U.S. Federal Reserve last week announced that it set up financing channels with nine other central banks, including the Reserve Bank of Australia and Monetary Authority of Singapore, to stabilize currency markets. That opened access to $450 billion of additional dollar funds, with a commitment to keep the arrangement in place for at least six months. However, analysts aren’t sure if that amount will be enough to contain the fear among investors who are hoarding dollars as market gains evaporate. Khoon Goh, head of research at Melbourne-based ANZ Bank, thinks the greenback will rise to 105 on the dollar index in the short term. As of Tuesday it stands near 102, and last was at 105 in late 2002. “The swap lines will help to some extent. However, it is unlikely to be sufficient given the extent of dollar demand. From a technical perspective, the dollar looks overbought, so some consolidation can be expected. However, this is likely just a pause before another push higher,” Goh told CNBC in an email. The Fed announced open-ended additional stimulus on Monday, and Goh acknowledged that some steam came off the dollar rally. “We will probably see the greenback consolidate for a while, but the key will be how other major central banks respond as well,” he said. “If the (European Central Bank) and (Bank of Japan) also start to announce more measures of their own, that could still push the dollar index toward 105 over the short term.” The dollar spike isn’t surprising given extreme market volatility and investor fears that go along with it. But a number of aspects to the rise are worrying some analysts: Any solution to the dollar frenzy is linked to an eventual easing of the coronavirus infection rate, said Goh. “We will need to see the COVID-19 new infection numbers peak and start to trend lower before we see a bottom to the risk selloff and a turn in the dollar strength,” he said. However, Divya Devesh, of Standard Chartered, said the moves by the Fed could be a silver lining to unabated dollar demand. The objective of those daily operations is to convince market participants that sufficient dollars will be readily available. That in turn should support financial institutions in lending to each other more confidently. “It is all about signaling,” Devesh said. The number one risk for world markets associated with dollar shortfall, is a potential rise in defaults. Traders are watching the spread between two bank lending rates, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the Overnight Indexed Swap (OIS). Since 2008, that spread has been seen as a warning sign of credit risk within the banking industry. “The key issue facing policy makers is to ensure that the economic challenge doesn’t lead to an insolvency event,” Divya says. He believes that the policy response, globally, has so far been strong and is likely to get more aggressive in the coming weeks. “In the meanwhile,” he said, “the markets will remain on high alert given the risks of an unintended spill over to credit markets.”	USD
5e5d092cbd5d9d5ac072765d	Crude Oil Price Outlook Mired by Coronavirus, Global GDP Growth	The price of crude oil jumped nearly 6% off its February lows last week after the commodity found technical support around a multi-year uptrend line and key level of confluence. This is subsequent to a major selloff in oil prices, however, which pushed WTI into a bear market to start the year with a decline of more than 20% from its January high. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView I noted in a recent oil forecast that the major selloff in crude oil and movement into safe-haven assetsis primarily attributable to resurfacing global growth fears, which stem overwhelmingly from the spread of a new coronavirus. Formally named as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization, the novel coronavirus outbreak is curbing economic activity – particularly in China – and weighing negatively on demand for crude oil. Meanwhile, crude oil price action has largely crumbled amid the revival of volatility and risk-aversion across the broader market. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView Oil volatility – measured using Cboe’s OVX Index – has receded from its early February high as market sentient begins to recover from its adverse knee-jerk reaction as China takes aggressive measures to curb the coronavirus. With preliminary sings that the growth rate in confirmed number of coronavirus cases is decelerating, the long-term economic impact could be minimal despite the recent stretch short-term turbulence and likely impact on first quarter GDP and oil demand. In turn, crude oil prices may be primed for an extended recovery so long as there is no destabilizing development like a sharp and unexpected spike in reported coronavirus cases or fatalities. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView Along with volatility, investor sentiment can also be quantified roughly by the US Treasury yield curve, which inverted again earlier this year for the first time since last October. Seeing that an inverted yield curve is believed to foreshadow a forthcoming recession by many market participants, its recent return to negative territory was unsurprisingly correlated to the slide in crude oil prices to a strong degree. Learn more: Top Crude Oil Facts Every Trader Should Know On that note, the three-month and 10-year Treasury yield spread has recovered back into positive territory recently and appears to have corresponded with a rebound in crude oil prices. Additional fundamental themes that may bolster crude oil price action include potential OPEC intervention and lingering Middle East uncertainty. OPEC might act to cut crude oil production in aims of rebalancing supply with the recent demand shock while next week’s Iran election could bring more hardliners into power and re-stoke concern over Iran-US tensions. Nevertheless, it seems as though coronavirus fears continue to linger and may continue dominating markets and likely stands to strong-arm the direction of crude oil.

5e7b421b2441047ed963c168	Thank you Congress: FTSE rallies on rescue package	The phenomenal US rescue package agreed late yesterday still has to get approved by Congress but the $2 trillion support which will be provided for both businesses and employees is set to get the green light later today. US stocks came roaring higher overnight, with the DJIA rising 11% and Asian markets uniformly closing higher. The FTSE proceeded to rise from a better opening. Sports retailer JD Sports, which over the last few days tried and failed to find ways around the government’s decision to close all non-essential shops still bounced 17% Wednesday as investors pinned their expectations on the rescue packages in the US and Britain covering the retailer’s losses. Banks are also faring better as some of their financial burden will now be shared with the states and in the ultimate expression of optimism airlines and hotel operators are still trading higher. However, while the generously high rescue packages will go a long way to soften the economic blow of the coronavirus in Europe and the US it will also largely depend how quickly countries shrug off the pandemic and whether China’s example of two to three months is as viable elsewhere given that other countries have handled the outbreak slightly differently. Sterling boosted by stock market revival The uplift in stocks infused sterling trading with some much needed encouragement and the GBP bounced nearly 1.7% against the dollar. Faced with grim forecasts for the German economy, the euro struggled against the pound. Europe’s largest economy has already been eroded last year by the US-China trade wars and US tariffs on major German imports; the coronavirus could now cause it to shrink by another 20% this year. The main reason why the currency is still holding against the dollar is the expectation that the US has yet to reach the full high of the corona crisis while Germany and other parts of Europe could be close to turning a corner.

5e7c70688cce243c325e7071	British Pound (GBP) Latest: GBP/USD Trending Higher Despite Poor Data	The tentative recovery in GBP/USD is continuing, with no strong signs yet of the rally running out of steam. This week’s advance has taken it from a low of 1.1447 Monday to just above 1.19 in early European trading Thursday and a near-term test of “round number” resistance at 1.20 is now possible in the hours and days ahead. Chart by IG (You can click on it for a larger image) Can Coronavirus Helicopter Money Bring Markets Back to Life? One sign of an improvement in sentiment towards the pair was that dire UK retail sales data for February, before any economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, failed to depress GBP/USD. There was no growth in retail sales year/year and declines were recorded for both the headline and ex-autos measures month-month. Thursday’s session will be dominated by a statement at 1200 GMT after the scheduled March meeting of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee. The BoE has already made two emergency cuts in UK Bank Rate so far this month and a further reduction is unlikely. However, the central bank will doubtless underscore its willingness to take even more radical measures – including an expansion of its quantitative easing policy.

5e681a4ed53f7f7b131418ae	EUR/USD Forex Market Trading Strategies: Sideways To Down Trading Expected	The daily chart of the EUR/USD Forex market has rallied strongly for 4 weeks. There have been 4 surges. Each is one or more big bars followed by one or more smaller bars. Three or more surges mean that the rally is a parabolic wedge buy climax. That typically attracts some profit taking. But it is also a sign of strong bulls. Today went below yesterday’s low. It was the 1st pullback in 13 days. The rally is therefore also a 13 bar bull microchannel. Traders have been so eager to buy that they have been buying above the prior day’s low for 13 days. They finally got an opportunity to buy a pullback. The bulls typically take that buy, expecting at least a scalp. However, it is the 1st sign that the strong bull trend is weakening. Bulls will take more profits soon because their stop is too far below. That creates too much risk. The easiest way to reduce risk is to take some profits. Consequently, traders should expect a couple of weeks of sideways to down trading to begin within the next week. The pullback usually tests the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the low of 4 days ago. It also typically tests the 20 day EMA and one or more breakout points. The most obvious is the January 1 high. The bears will probably not be able to create a bear trend without 1st forming a trading range. Traders should expect that bulls will buy the 1st 1 – 2 week selloff for either a test of this week’s high or for a resumption of the 4 week bull trend. The 5 minute chart of the EUR/USD Forex market sold off early in the Asian session. It fell below yesterday’s low overnight. However, this bear breakout was only 2 pips. Traders bought at yesterday’s low the the EUR/USD rallied 50 pips. The European session has been in a trading range for 6 hours. Day traders are scalping. The legs up and down are big enough for 20 – 30 pip scalps. The bulls want another bull candlestick on the daily chart. However, the open of the day is probably too far above. Alternatively, they do not want today to close on its low and below yesterday’s low. That would increase the chance of lower prices again tomorrow. At a minimum, they would like today to close above its midpoint. If they are successful, they will have a better chance of at least one more brief leg up for 1 – 3 days before there is a bigger profit-taking pullback. The bears always want the opposite. They want a bear trend reversal. They know that is unlikely. But they will have a better chance of a minor reversal for a couple weeks if they can start to get some days closing near their lows. With the past 6 hours being sideways, today will probably remain in a trading range. Day traders will look for reversals.	USD
5e5d31b7d3c8fc0aa1ab81e0	Yen Gains Momentum	This week on global stocks was absolutely brutal. We dropped from almost all-time highs to the lowest levels since October. Almost 4 months of rises wiped out in a week. That has to hurt. On the Forex Market, we have the dominance of safe heaven currencies: CHF and JPY In this analysis, I will analyze the situation on the Japanese Yen. First, Yen Index. First signs of power appeared on Monday, when the index confirmed the false breakout below important mid-term support (827). Other steps were made on Wednesday and Thursday, when the price broke the mid-term down trendline and the horizontal resistance on the 837. Yesterday’s candle just made everything clear – buyers are fully controlling the situation at the moment. Sentiment for Japanese currency is currently positive. Now, USDJPY, which we analyzed recently. In our previous analysis we pointed out the giant symmetric triangle and the breakout to the upside. In theory, that was a great buy signal. Just in theory though as in practice, the price met a worthy opponent – highs from the 2019. This is were the price reversed and created a false breakout pattern. Now we are back below the upper line of the triangle, which is a very negative signal for the nearest future. Now, everyone’s favorite, one and only – GBP/JPY. Here, the situation is pretty clear. The price broke the 141 support, which automatically switched the sentiment into a negative one. This level was a crucial resistance from October to December 2019 and later a crucial support, till yesterday. Price staying below this area is definitely pessimistic. This is a modal window.	JPY
5e5d08fbbd5d9d5ac0727611	US Recession Watch: Recession Odds Rekindled as Coronavirus Festers	Odds that the US economy will soon slip into a recession are likely back on the rise. This follows our prior US Recession Watch that highlighted a downshift in recession probabilities and the US-China trade war late last year. Now, as the coronavirus hits confidence and sends a shockwave across the global supply chain, economic data is starting to deteriorate rapidly. A gloomy Markit PMI report just revealed that US business activity – notably in the services sector – contracted during February. US recession odds have been rekindled in response, which is reflected by the abrupt pivot lower in the US Dollar Index alongside a deepening of the US Treasury yield curve inversion (3m10s). A corresponding rise in FOMC rate cut bets has since occurred, which stands to weigh negatively on USD price action. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView A staggering rally in USD price action across major currency pairs since January 01 pushed the Greenback up 3.5% on balance prior to the February 21 selloff sparked by the Markit PMI contraction. The dismal datapoint crushed the US Dollar Index from the 99.88 price level – the highest reading since April 21, 2017 – down to the 99.30 area (a daily decline of about 0.5%). Technical support was initially provided to USD price action around its 9-day exponential moving average. Although, the US Dollar has potential to keep bleeding. Perhaps the 23.6% or 38.2% Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent bullish leg will be looked toward as possible downside targets by USD bears if there is a protracted acceleration in FOMC rate cut bets. Overnight swaps have priced in an additional 15-basis points of interest rate cuts for June 2020 Fed meeting since the relatively-less dovish January 2020 FOMC minutes crossed the wires last week. The implied Fed funds rate for the June 10, 2020 meeting now stands at 1.307%, which compares to the current effective rate of 1.584%. Nevertheless, the US Dollar’s near-vertical ascent during the first seven weeks of the year seems underpinned by widespread demand for safe-haven currencies, which is a facet of the forex market where USD reigns king. The US Dollar Index has correspondingly formed a bullish golden cross of its longer term 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. In theory, this impending technical development might provide a positive tailwind to USD price action. While the total economic impact caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak is yet to be determined, preliminary indicators and measurements of business activity paint a pessimistic picture. China car sales during the first two-weeks of February cratered 92% year-over-year. A recent survey of sales managers at Chinese companies shows that business confidence fell off a cliff to its lowest reading on record. Around half of the 109 US businesses polled with operations in China noted a material lack of workers due to widespread travel restrictions and quarantines mandated by the Chinese government. The Chinese economy is only operating at about 55% of capacity according to a recent report from the Ministry of Commerce. Meanwhile, tourism across Asia is at a standstill judging by Hong Kong average visitor arrivals data, which crashed to under than 3,000 travelers per day and compares to last year’s figure of 200,000 per day. In turn, Song Xiaowu, a Chinese economist and government policy advisor, stated that China may need to adjust its 2020 GDP growth target as first quarter growth could drop to 3%. Similarly, HSBC slashed its 1Q-2020 China GDP forecast to 4.1% from 5.8% citing the coronavirus impact. The unexpected and debilitating shockwave sent to the global supply chainwill likely have a lasting impact on business activity above all else. This fundamental backdrop typically bodes well for the USD on balance. Considering how China is the second largest economy in the world, it is expected that the hit directly to Chinese GDP will drag total trade and business activity lower across the globe in a similar fashion. This theme was just highlighted in a study published by the World Trade Organization on how global merchandise trade growth is likely to weaken further into 2020. Meanwhile, American businesses have already started to sound the alarm bell. Apple Inc (AAPL) – the biggest US company by market cap – announced it sees its revenue at risk and not expected to hit its revenue guidance for the quarter owing to the coronavirus outbreak. As previously mentioned, the latest flash PMI report from IHS Markit revealed that US economic output contracted for the first time since October 2013. The composite output index took a tumble to 49.6 for February and is down from a reading of 53.3 the month prior. Even more worrisome than the composite PMI figure was the nosedive in the services business activity index, which fell at the fastest rate on record to a fresh 76-month low. The latest Markit PMI report has consequently brought the overall resilience of the US economy into question as business activity contracts. At the same time, recession odds seem set to rise seeing that the services sector is a primary component of US GDP. Risk of recession permeating across the broader market can be observed by taking a look at the US Treasury yield curve given its historical usefulness in predicting potential economic downturns. A notable flattening of the US Treasury yield curve has occurred since traders caught wind of the novel coronavirus outbreak earlier this year. Specifically, the 3m10s and 2s10s yield curve spreads dropped from 30-bps and 34-bps respectively at the beginning of the year to the latest measurements of -0.15% and 0.11%. This largely stems from the anticipated drag on global GDP growth as investors flock to safety provided by long-dated government bonds such as 10-year or 30-year Treasuries. With the US Treasury yield curve inverted once again along the 3m10s curve (i.e. the three-month and 10-year maturities), market sentiment could deteriorate further as investors take notice of rising recession odds. Nevertheless, the US economy is and will likely remain the ‘best out of a bad bunch’ due to solid consumer spending and a strong jobs market. Upcoming nonfarm payrolls and US consumer confidence reports could thus carry greater credence regarding USD price action, broader market sentiment and the risk of a recession going forward. -- Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight	USD
5e66b6d56dbd5046bd1e3781	Recession Risk Intensifies as Crude Crashes & Coronavirus Festers	What Markets are Rising as the Dow Jones and Oil Collapse? Panic-struck stock market investors seem to have taken notice of the rising likelihood that we are going into a recession in the not-too-distant future. A staggering selloff across global equities over recent weeks, driven initially by expected economic fallout from the coronavirus, has gained pace after the latest destabilizing black-swan event: a crash in crude oil prices. According to the Federal Reserve, the probability of a US recession occurring over the next 12-months, as predicted by the Treasury yield curve spread, was clocked at 31% on February 28. Although distressed credit markets caught a breather following an emergency Fed rate cut last week, its first since the global financial crisis and collapse of Lehman Brothers, the 10-year and three-month interest rate spread (3m10s) on US Treasuries took a 20-basis point tumble in response to the latest crude oil price crash. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView The 3m10s US Treasury yield curve spread now stands at a positive 18-bps, but this popular recession gauge appears to be headed back toward inversion territory. This might follow rising default risk on high-yield US corporate debt, which presents contagion risk to the broader financial system and economy. Why Does the US Yield Curve Inversion Matter? In fact, the options-adjusted spread (OAS)above the risk-free rate of return for high-yield corporate debt exploded higher to 5.5 percentage points as of March 06 – prior to the 30% gap lower in crude oil just witnessed. With crude now trading around $30.00/bbl, far below the approximate $50.00/bbl break-even price for US shale oil producers, fund outflows have soared from the iShares High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (Ticker symbol: HYG), which has over 10% of its market value exposed to poor credit quality energy companies. Likewise, countries heavily dependent on oil exports like Canada or Mexico have seen their currencies plummet relative to safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar and Japanese Yen. At the same time, the broader US Dollar Index (Ticker symbol: DXY), which is heavily weighted to EUR/USD performance, has cratered to an 18-month low as the Euro gains ground against the Greenback. Selling pressure in the USD was sparked amid rekindled recession odds following the IHS Markit PMI report for February, which detailed a contraction in US business activity, and notably the services sector, to a 76-month low. As such, it seems likely that recession risk has intensified alongside growing coronavirus concerns and adverse effects from a crash in crude oil.

5e95e04f667aea221b02f99c	US Retail Sales March Preview: Can consumers stare down unemployment?	American consumption is thought to have fallen off a cliff in March as unemployment soared with government ordered shutdowns and the closure of many stores in about half the country. Monthly retail sales are expected to decline 8% and purchases excluding automobiles to drop 4.8%. Car dealerships in almost all of the major population centers are closed. The range of estimates in the Reuters survey is from -24% to -0.9%. Sales were down 0.5% in February, ex-autos lost o.4% and the control group was flat. If the predictions are accurate this would be far worse than the demand destruction during the 2008 financial crisis. Even at the height of the crash in the fall of that year the largest single decrease was 3.9% in November and the six negative months from July to December all told equaled12.4%. Reuters Uncertainty is high over the extent of the retail drawdown because such massive and nearly instantaneous unemployment, 17 million people have filed jobless claims over the past three weeks, has never occurred before. Any estimate for spending depends on how consumers, employed and not, view the future and the likelihood of returning to work and normal life. Unemployment insurance will replace a portion of the income lost for those laid off but it cannot maintain usual levels of consumption. Internet sales have risen dramatically and though it seems probable that they have not fully compensated for the closure of much of the brick and mortar establishment the numbers are as yet unknown. Some of these questions will be answered in the March retail figures which break out non-store sales as the Census Bureau calls on-line purchases. Some food purchases have climbed substantially in the first week of April. Fresh produce sales are up 14.2% over the same week in 2019, frozen food sales are 47.4% higher and dry goods or shelf-stable purchases are up 48.1%. Food service sales however remain in deep decline and are one reason produce supplies are plentiful and often reduced in price. The well-known dependence of the US economy on consumption may play through to the largest quarterly decline in GDP on record in the second quarter. In the final three months of 2008 the US economy contracted 6.3% followed by 6.4% in January February and March of 2009 and -0.7% in April May and June. After the three quarters of recession GDP expanded 2.2% in the third quarter of 2009, 5.6% in the fourth, 3.7% in the first quarter of 2010 and 1.7% in the he second, averaging 3.3% in the 12 months after the recession. The estimate for growth in the first three months from the Atlanta Fed has dropped from 3.1% to 1% and a new projection will be released after Wednesday’s retail sales. Much will depend on the attitude of consumers. For the majority of laid-off workers, many of whom are hourly and on the lower end of the pay scale, consumption must fall as their income has become unemployment insurance and savings. It is the remaining 150 million employed Americans who will determine the immediate course of the economy. Do they view the work stoppages as temporary and have they been willing to maintain a relatively normal level of consumption through the shutdowns? Michigan consumer sentiment in March was 89.1 in a poll conducted before the majority of the job losses became unemployment statistics. April’s preliminary score of 71 brings outlook down to the level of December 2011 and the fitful recovery from the financial crisis. Michigan Consumer Sentiment FXStreet Retail sales in the second half of 2011 averaged a monthly gain of 0.4% which helped to supply a 2.4% GDP expansion in the period. The $2 trillion support and stimulus package passed by Washington which offers business assistance in maintaining payrolls for several months and the loan and securities purchase programs enacted by the Federal Reserve aim to help insulate against further massive layoffs and maintain consumption. But it is unknown how successful they will be and how consumers will respond. The enormous job losses perpetrated by the public health response to the Coronavirus may or may not be temporary. Restitution in the labor market depends on the speed and extent of the reopening of full economic life. The potential for a plunge in consumption commensurate with employment holds considerable danger for the US economy as it likely entails further job losses and the prospect of a self- reinforcing economic decline. For the dollar the safe-haven panic of March has waned and though the unemployment claims numbers have set a high standard for disaster they are only one side of the story. The other is the impact of such job losses on economic activity in the United States. Currency markets are not so inured to this catastrophe that a worse than forecast retail sales for March, implying even greater collapses in the months ahead and by extension to the rest of the world, will not bring back the dollar safety trade. If the reliably free-spending consumer sector in the United States has faltered there may yet be much more to worry about.	USD
5e788eb052e79d7c12f45887	Grim start to the week	The FTSE is trading lower and US futures are pointing to a weaker opening in the face of the inexorable corona spread on both continents. With the US now rising to the third highest place in terms of the number of diagnosed cases the forecast for the country’s economy is being frantically revised lower. EIA crude oil stocks on Wednesday and initial jobless claims on Thursday will be the most relevant indicators this week because they are the quickest to reflect what has happened on the ground last week, when movement restrictions came in and a number of US cities brought in closures of cafes, bars and restaurants. The bigger economic indicators have a time lag and are showing February data which has, for the moment, become as good as irrelevant. On the FTSE ITV took a 10% hit to its shares after it suspend the filming of some of its most watched soaps because of the social distancing restrictions and also decided to not to pay out a dividend. The UK government is mulling bringing in even stricter measures which could potentially include banning all non-essential shopping, a move that would hit fashion retailers and sportswear makers like Next and JD Sports. A ciggie in a crisis? Among the very few stocks still trading in the black are tobacco firm Imperial Brands and retailers Sainsbury's and Morrisons which are still struggling to restock their shops emptied during the corona panic buying. Supermarkets are also one of the few industries currently hiring staff rather than firing. The pound perked up at the start of the day but the optimism didn’t survive the onslaught of news and the currency nudged lower quickly to challenge the $1.16 level.	GBP
5e60d07910c59d6385d37e2f	U.S. dollar struggles to make headway as traders price in more Fed cuts	SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar struggled to make headway on Thursday, as very low U.S. yields and the prospect of even more monetary easing held back gains, while virus fears supported the safe-haven yen. Strong data showing U.S. services activity at a one-year high and hiring growth had pushed the greenback 0.3% higher on the euro overnight. But with benchmark U.S. 10-year yields US10YT=RR just a tad above 1% and futures markets pricing another 50 basis points of Federal Reserve cuts by July <0#FF:>, the greenback failed to forge ahead in Asia, leaving the euro EUR= steady at $1.1136. “The ongoing decline in U.S. yields and the rise in volatility is continuing to cause a position squeeze,” said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank. “Assuming that the Fed is going to enact several more rate cuts in the next month or two - including out of the 17-18 March meeting, then for the short term at least there is some further weakness in the U.S. dollar to play out.” An emergency 50 basis point interest rate cut by the Fed on Tuesday had sent the dollar backwards against most Asian currencies and down to a five-month low of 106.84 yen. [MKTS/GLOB] The strong performance of former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic nomination campaign had pulled the dollar firmer than that overnight, with an increase in risk appetite drawing investors away from the safety of the Japanese currency. Biden is considered less likely to raise taxes and impose new regulations on business than rival Bernie Sanders. But deep concern about the widening economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak had the yen rising 0.2% through Thursday and last trading at 107.33 per dollar JPY=. Mainland China reported a rise in new infections on Thursday, deaths are mounting deaths globally, Italy has closed its schools and California has declared a state of emergency as cases there increase. The International Monetary Fund now expects world growth will drop to its slowest since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. All of which, combined with the expectation of more monetary easing to offset the damage, snuffed a rally in the Australian and New Zealand dollars. [AUD/] The Aussie AUD=D3, which has climbed nearly 3% from an 11-year low hit last week, eased to $0.6619. The kiwi NZD=D3, which has climbed almost 2% from a Monday trough, sat at $0.6297. “The talk of the town now is what does quantitative easing look like in Australia, when is it likely to be deployed and how much of that is priced in,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone. Central bank action also weighed on the Canadian dollar, which slipped lower after the Bank of Canada delivered its biggest interest rate cut in more than 10 years. The loonie CAD=D3 last traded at 1.3396 per dollar. The British pound held overnight gains after the incoming Bank of England governor said he would wait for more clarity about the virus before moving interest rates, rather than rushing to an emergency cut.

Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com As global stock markets caught up to yesterdays closed in the US, the US Dollar began to pull back. However, on a 240-minute the DXY has already been consolidating in a pennant formation since reaching the 161.8% Fibonacci extension from the highs in mid-February to the lows on March 9th. The consolidation is near a trendline dating back to May 2018. If the DXY does break higher from here, the target is near 109.80. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com EUR/USD often trades the inverse to the DXY, as the Euro makes up almost 58% of the US Dollar Index. So, it would make sense to see a similar, opposite move in EUR/USD. On a 240-minute Price action in the EUR/USD has been moving lower since the highs on February 20th, stalled on March 20th, and began consolidating in a flag like formation. This too seems as its ready for its next move. If price does break lower out of the flag formation, the current target is near parity (1.0050). (EUR/USD can still move higher, as high as 1.1070 and still be in a valid flag formation, just note that from wherever price breaks lower from the flag, the flagpole needs to be adjusted to that breakdown point. ) Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com On a daily GBP/USD chart we can the US Dollar pair is trading in a resistance zone, just below 1.2000. If price holds below this key psychological resistance area and pulls back, it would provide more evidence that the DXY can move higher. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com The set-ups and resistance in these US Dollar pairs provide evidence that DXY may be headed higher. We have seen an extreme move off the lows on March 9th from 94.60 to roughly 103. It’s hard to imagine we could see a move like that again soon. But then again, the way these markets have been moving over the last month, it is possible!	USD
5e5d090dbd5d9d5ac0727629	Japanese Yen Technical Outlook Still Points Higher as USD/JPY Soars	The anti-risk Japanese Yen tumbled on Wednesday amid a broadly optimistic day in equities across the world. The Nikkei 225, DAX 30 and Dow Jones closed 0.89%, 0.79% and 0.40% to the upside respectively. At home, the US Dollar rose alongside front-end government bond yields indicating an improving outlook on the economy. As a result, USD/JPY spiked 1.37% in its best single-day performance since August. The chirpy mood in stocks continues to reflect the markets shrugging off the downside impact of the coronavirus on global growth. China did announce a couple of measures to help deal with the Wuhan virus such as liquidity injections. During the North American trading session, rosy housing and PPI data underscored the confidence in domestic conditions. CAD rose after rosy domestic CPI data. Market mood stalled after the FOMC meeting minutes however. The document continued to underscore the divide between dovish expectations and a more “neutral” tone from the central bank. The Fed anticipates that during the first half of this year, the balance sheet would moderate as outstanding repos decrease over time. An unwinding of its repurchasing operations is arguably a downside risk for sentiment. Given the aggressive drop in the Japanese Yen, it should be noted that the dominant uptrend in JPY as a whole is still intact. Using my majors-based Yen index – which averages its performance against USD, AUD, GBP and EUR – rising support from 2018 has yet to be tested. There may be room for near-term weakness which could take Yen prices on average to lows from January and December. Chart Created Using TradingView Top-tier event risk during Thursday’s Asia Pacific trading session is arguably the Australian jobs report. Data outcomes from the country have been tending to surprise to the upside as of late. More of the same from upcoming local employment data could undermine RBA rate cut bets. This is as AUD/USD struggles to clear key support with ominous signals of fading downside momentum. Asia Pacific equities may follow the rosy lead from Wall Street which would likely bode ill for the anti-risk Japanese Yen. Given the US Dollar’s relatively high yield, it is benefiting from the risk-on tone in markets from a carry perspective. That is consequentially sapping some of the appeal of the “pro-risk” Australian Dollar and similarly-behaving New Zealand Dollar. USD/JPY closed at its highest since early May as the currency pair swiftly took out the January high followed by peaks from late May. That has left JPY facing the next critical psychological barrier which is a range between 112.30 to 111.92. The latter consists of highs from 2019. Maintaining the uptrend in the medium-term is rising support from August – red line below.

5e833d1449415a4d8d500e9a	Forex Volatility Set To Increase	Quick Take The ebbs and flows in the Forex market were rather subdued on Monday, with volatility measures dropping to the lowest in the last month as the progressive decrease in vol stays the course. Nonetheless, the new normal is for currency swings of a much larger magnitude than we were used to before all hell broke loose. Besides, with a VIX index still above 50.00 and month/quarter-end to kick in, there is a real potential for increased activity in equity/bond and FX today. As an aperitif, we’ve seen sudden spikes in the Yen, US Dollar and Aussie crosses during Tuesday’s final fiscal day in the Tokyo fix. At the risk of sounding too reiterative, it’s worth emphasizing that while the short–term picture has worsened for the US Dollar amid the flooding of dollars into the system by the Fed and a better tone in equities, do not underestimate the phase where we are at, in which based on the bullish breakout in the USD index, further upside is still justified. The rest of FX saw the Canadian Dollar as the weakest link, finding follow through after the emergency dovish move by the BOC (cut rates by 50bp to its lowest bound and started QE). On the flip side, the Aussie drew solid buy-side flows as the Australian PM pulled out the big guns with a very generous fiscal package to combat COVID-19. The Pound extended its impressive run too, although mildly. The remaining currencies (EUR, JPY, CHF, NZD) consolidated. It’s month/quarter-end in financial markets This means there is increased potential for equity/bond and FX re-balancing flows. The Global FX Committee (GFXS) issued a statement last week, still applicable for today, in which it warns: “FX participants may execute larger than usual volumes during end-of-month benchmark fixings. ”Equities trade with a better tone The S&P500 managed to recoup Friday’s losses by rising 3.4%, which could be in part related to month-end re-balancing. In Asia, stocks, especially in the Australian index ASX 200, also traveled northbound (+7%) as detailed emerged of a third fiscal package from the Morrison government. Trump caves in Trump extended guidelines on social distancing across the US to April 30, which is a sudden walk-back from his earlier intention to reopen the country. The latest projections by Dr. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task, about millions of Americans being infected and estimates of 100,000 to 200,000 deaths appear to have been a wake-up call for the President. What else is happening? There has been a worrying rebound in the number of COVID-19 cases in South Korea, while on the flip side, the reported rate of new infections in Italy, Spain or Portugal has slowed down. It’s also encouraging that Ford partnered with GE health to produce ventilators, alongside news that Mercedes F1 team has teamed up with engineers at University College London and UCL Hospital to build a device pumping oxygen to the lungs without the need for a ventilator, with estimates for a production rate of 1,000/day near term. This DB report digs deeper For a more in-depth update on how cases have developed globally, the Deutsche Bank Research Team does a great job in this daily report. It underscores that “global cases have risen to over 700,000, with the US driving the bulk of the growth rate. ”Subdued ebbs and flows in Forex On Monday, currencies traded quietly with the USD regaining some of its lost ‘mojo’. In terms of range expansions, the G8 FX complex averaged much smaller swings as the market takes the foot off the gas pedal end of quarter adjustments.

5e5d07b4203be655205b7aba	Dollar at 4-month highs against euro on virus concerns, economic outlook	The dollar hit a four-month high against the euro on Monday as concerns about the coronavirus boosted demand for safe havens, while a bullish outlook for the U.S. economy and weak data in the eurozone made the greenback relatively more attractive than the single currency. People across China trickled back to work on Monday after an extended Lunar New Year holiday as the government eased restrictions imposed to counter the coronavirus, but the World Health Organization said the number of cases outside China could be just “the tip of the iceberg.” Investors are concerned that the spreading virus will dent the global economic outlook. Relatively strong economic data in the United States is also making the greenback more attractive than other currencies. Data on Friday showed that U.S. job growth accelerated in January. Data on Monday also revealed that Italian industrial output was much weaker than expected in December. We had much stronger than expected U.S. data, coupled with much weaker than expected eurozone data, said Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. At the same time, we have the safe haven bid from the coronavirus. That is killing EM and really benefiting the dollar, and to a lesser extent the yen and Swiss, Thin said. Political uncertainty in Germany is an additional headwind for the euro. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), on Monday confirmed she would not run for chancellor in next year’s federal election but added that she would remain party chair until another candidate is found. The euro fell to a four-month low of $1.0925. The British pound dropped to a two-month low of $1.2870 before rebounding to $1.2938. The Australian dollar sank to $0.6656, the lowest since 2009, before gaining back to $0.6682. Australias economy is highly correlated to Chinas.	EUR

5e95c1d710dc0f05bff4d211	Wall Street opens decisively higher on strong risk appetite	Wall Street's main indexes opened sharply higher on Tuesday following Monday's slump as risk-on flows seem to be dominating the financial markets once again. As of writing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.25% on the day while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were adding 2.2% and 2.35%, respectively. Reflecting the upbeat market mood, the CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, is down nearly 6% on the day. 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 all trade in the positive territory following the opening bell. The risk-sensitive Technology Index is up 2.55% on the day and the Financials Index is adding 2.5%. Earlier in the day, JPMorgan Chase & Co reported lower-than-expected net income and EPS for the first quarter but noted that the equity markets revenue increased by 28% amid heightened volatility. At the moment, JPM is up 2.8% on the day.	EQUITY
5e78b0a5c078ac22b4de8b47	3 Stock Market Lessons from 2008 as Congress Debates Another Crisis Bill	As my colleague Joe Perry noted in his Week Ahead report on Friday, traders this week should “expect cases of coronavirus to increase and government interventions to continue. We’re in the early innings of a long ballgame.” With markets entering the next phase in the war against the virus, the key factor to watch this week will be the progress of a “big bazooka” fiscal policy bill out of the US. Over the weekend, the much-ballyhooed $1T+ package, failed to pass a procedural vote in the Senate, which is operating at reduced capacity as one US Senator, Rand Paul, has tested positive for coronavirus, causing several Senators who were in close contact with him to self-quarantine. In any event, Senate Democrats and Republicans are scheduled to reconvene midday today to try to hash out their differences, with another vote expected around 1pm ET. The whole saga is reminiscent of the initial vote on the last major US government fiscal crisis response, the Troubled Asset Repurchase Program (TARP) in late September 2008. Spurred on by early rumblings of the anti-deficit “Tea Party” movement, the first vote on the much-needed bill failed in the House of Representatives on September 29, leading to a 777-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), at its time, the largest ever point drop. Perhaps spooked by the precipitous drop in stocks, the House subsequently passed the bill handily a couple days later on October 3. Source: TradingView, GAIN Capital What actionable trading takeaways can we draw from 2008 for the current week? 1. Many of the same politicians that initially voted against TARP remain in their posts to this day, so hopefully they recall their lessons from that fateful period. We hope it won’t take another failed vote and deep market swoon to get the notoriously divided Congress to reach an agreement for the good of the American people (and stock markets!). With full credit to Winston Churchill, at a minimum, “You can always count on the Americans to do the right thing… after they have tried everything else.” 2. Even the passage of the much-needed fiscal stimulus bill in 2008 did not prevent the stock market from falling further, though it did at least help stocks stabilize for a period shortly thereafter, followed by one last foray to new lows in Q1 2009. 3. As we’ve noted before, the stock market WILL bottom before infection and economic data starts to improve, just as it bottomed in early 2009 before housing market and broader activity figures turned higher. Markets always “climb a wall of worry” coming out of panicked periods, with (often years of) skepticism toward the initial bullish move.	EQUITY
5e94f386646a455939b68c15	Stocks start the week with losses – all about earnings now?	The major indices were mixed today following the biggest 1-week gain since 1974. Stocks dropped at the open. And by late morning, the major indices were trading at session lows. There was a bit of a comeback during lunch, then stocks were sideways. A rally in the last 40 minutes of trading helped narrow today’s loss. But the S&P and DOW still finished the day in negative territory for the first time in 3 sessions. However, the NASDAQ finished higher, helped out by a 7.0% jump in Netflix (NFLX) and new 52-week high for the stock. Here’s where the major indices ended the day: Crude Oil (CL) dropped for the 2nd day in a row, even though OPEC members agreed to an output cut. With a 1.5% loss, Crude Oil finished at $22.41 a barrel. On Sunday, OPEC and its allies agreed to the biggest output cut in history. President Trump applauded the agreement and said it “will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs” in the U.S. Caterpillar (CAT) suffered the biggest loss in the DOW today, down 8.7%. The move came after a Bank of America analyst downgraded the stock. Stimulus checks are trickling in, with the first deposits occurring over the weekend. The U.S. Treasury says that millions of Americans should receive deposits on Wednesday. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) will kick off earnings season tomorrow.

5e8b121d34315542b2205152	Dollar rises against yen as Japan ready to declare state of emergency	LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar stalled against most currencies on Monday but continued its rise versus the Japanese yen as the rate of deaths from coronavirus in Europe slowed while deaths in Japan and elsewhere in Asia accelerated. The yen fell, while the Australian and New Zealand dollars, which tend to benefit from sharper risk appetite, rose. “The FX implication is yen weakness as Japan’s virus situation worsens and equities bounce,” said Kit Juckes, Societe Generale’s macro strategist. The dollar rose 0.5% to 109 yen JPY=EBS, after rising to a 10-day high of 109.38 earlier. The Australian dollar rose 1.3% at 0.6071 per U.S. dollar AUD=D3. The euro was neutral versus the U.S. currency at 1.0805 EUR=EBS. An index that tracks the dollar against six major currencies was also flat at 100.68 =USD. Juckes said the game-changer for the euro “would be a move towards some version of ‘Coronabonds’ at tomorrow’s Eurogroup meeting”. “Absent that, I’m not sure the euro has much home-grown potential to bounce,” he said. Euro zone finance ministers are likely to converge on Tuesday on three quick options to support the economy during the coronavirus epidemic. Italy reported its lowest daily death toll for more than two weeks on Sunday. France also reported a slowing daily death toll, and Germany its fourth straight daily drop in new cases. But Indonesia on Monday confirmed 218 new infections, the biggest daily jump since the first cases were announced a month ago. Japan also will declare a state of emergency as early as Tuesday, media reported, as a shortage of beds and a rise in cases linked to hospitals push Tokyo’s medical system to the brink of collapse. However, market gauges for one-month implied volatility in the euro and Japanese yen have calmed down, falling to their lowest in one month, a sign that investors do not expect any longer wild price swings in euro-dollar and dollar-yen in the next couple of weeks. EUR1MO=FN JPY1MO=FN Speculators’ net short U.S. dollar positioning in the latest week touched its highest since May 2018, according to Reuters calculations and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. As leveraged funds expect the U.S. currency to weaken, the cost to swap euros into dollars on a three-month basis eased, showing there is “less pressure” on euro, yen and sterling investors to fund dollar requirements, Monex Europe analyst Simon Harvey said. Dollar borrowing rates via the 3-month euro-dollar FX swap EURCBS3M=ICAP fell to a 12-year low of minus 65 basis points, indicating that European borrowers are able to borrow the greenback at a discount. This rate had swung to a 2011 European crisis-era high of more than 150 bps two weeks earlier. “But the funding strain is still there,” Harvey said. Elsewhere, the euro was up 0.1% versus the Swiss franc at 1.0569 EURCHF=EBS. The amount of cash that domestic commercial banks hold with the Swiss National Bank (SNB) rose last week, data showed on Monday. The pound was up 0.3% at $1.2308 GBP=D3 and up 0.5% against the euro at 87.71 pence EURGBP=D3, having slipped overnight on reports that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been hospitalized with persistent COVID-19 symptoms.

5e93a6aa50eeb81ddb31cdcf	Japan falls more than 2%; oil prices jump as OPEC and allies finalize record production cut	Stocks in Asia declined on Monday as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies reached an agreement on a record oil production cut. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 slipped 2.33% to close at 19,043.40 as shares of FamilyMart dropped 7.17% while the Topix index fell 1.69% to end its trading day at 1,405.91. South Korea’s Kospi also declined 1.88% to close at 1,825.76 as shares of chipmaker SK Hynix dropped 3.21%. Mainland Chinese stocks declined on the day, with the Shanghai composite shedding 0.49% to about 2,783.05 while the Shenzhen composite fell 0.799% to around 1,707.46. Overall, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index dipped 0.21%. Markets in Hong Kong and Australia were closed on Monday for Easter Monday. Meanwhile, oil prices pared gains but remained in positive territory in the afternoon of Asian trading hours. International benchmark Brent crude futures were up 0.86% to $31.75 per barrel. U.S. crude futures added 1.76% to $23.85 per barrel. The moves came after OPEC and its allies, known collectively as OPEC+, finalized an agreement to cut production by 9.7 million barrels per day. That’s the single largest output cut in history. “That they could cobble a historic deal in the face of unprecedented demand shortfall suggests that oil markets will not be as rattled and so there should be a floor (on prices),” Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday. He did, however, describe the deal as “very fraught.” OPEC+ is hoping that nations outside of the group, including the U.S., Canada and Norway, will also cut back on production in an effort to shore up prices. While Trump had previously stopped short of saying the U.S. would scale back production, he has noted that market forces would naturally curb output. Varathan said the question remained over “how much higher oil prices can sustainably go.” “The free market cuts, so to speak, that the U.S. has provided will probably not have much legs to go on because they’ll then adjust to upward prices and then that’s gonna cause a little bit more unhappiness with Russia and Saudi (Arabia),” he said. Developments surrounding the global coronavirus pandemic also likely continued to weigh on investor sentiment, with more than 1.8 million confirmed cases globally while at least 112,241 lives have been taken, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was last at 99.208 after declining from levels above 100 last week. The Japanese yen traded at 107.81 per dollar after seeing levels above 108.8 last week. The Australian dollar changed hands at $0.6353 after rising from levels below $0.62 in the previous trading week. — CNBC’s Pippa Stevens contributed to this report.	JPY
5e95d6eb9e35177201ad268d	UK stocks fail to catch wider market optimism	Stocks in the US and mainland Europe have been on the rise today, with optimism over a potential loosening in restrictions providing a boost for now. However, UK housebuilders are leading a decline as the FTSE 350 fails to catch a bid. Gold prices have continued to rise, with Polymetal and Fresnillo surging as a result. Global markets have taken solace from a better-than-expected batch of Chinese data, with exports declining at a rate of -6.6% (well below expectations of -14%). The coronavirus crisis continues to dominate sentiment yet talk of Austria and Spain starting to relax rules over which businesses can open will no doubt provide a chink of light in a sea of darkness. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile noting that for any step taken to alleviate the current lockdown on movement, there is also a heightened chance that we will see cases start to rise once more. With the IMF forecasting the worst recession in almost a century, there is a clear disconnect between the economic and market outlook right now. UK bulls are clearly still in holiday mode today, with the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 both underperforming their mainland European and US counterparts. Chief amongst the losers have been the housebuilders, with the prospect of an economic collapse alongside a widespread halting of property transactions dragging the sector lower. The recent pullback in house prices in the face of Brexit uncertainty has shifted many housebuilders onto a build-to-rent strategy, which is now coming under pressure as the long-term rental market is swamped by holiday lets and Airbnb rentals. The collapse in rental yields across the country highlights just how tough the housebuilders currently have it, with many landlords having to accept rents that are 30% lower than previously expected. With the Centres for Economics and Business Research highlighting a potential 13% decline in house prices this year, market bulls are shifting their attention elsewhere for the time being. Gold prices have outperformed yet again today, with traders willing to cast aside any risk-on sentiment once again to drive the precious metal into a fresh seven-year high. With central bank balance sheets on the rise, and government debt soaring, gold is likely to remain a big play for investors who have been desperately trying to get their hands on the physical asset since this crisis began. That desire for gold has also shown its face on the FTSE 100, where Fresnillo and Polymetal find themselves near the top of the leaderboard once more.	EQUITY
5e83466c0a93c67d669fb4ff	Stock market won’t hit coronavirus lows until these 3 criteria are met, says Goldman Sachs	Stock-market analysts at Goldman Sachs believe the S&P 500 will end this year more than 19% above current levels, but warned investors in a note this weekend that there will be short-term pain the markets in coming weeks. “After a swift 18% rally [last week], the most common investor question was ‘has a new bull market started ?’” Goldman analysts, led by David Kostin, wrote. “Strategically, we continue to expect the S&P 500 SPX, -1.60% will rise to 3,000 by year’s end,” they added. “Tactically, however, we believe it is likely that the market will turn lower in the coming weeks, and caution investors against chasing this rally.” Kostin pointed out that if the S&P 500’s closing low of 2,304 on Monday were in fact the nadir of the bear market, it would be the fastest such peak-to-trough in market history, at 23 trading days, as the median bear market since the mid-19th century has taken 17 months to find a bottom. “None has made the trip in fewer than three months,” he added. Furthermore, history shows that bear markets often feature aggressive rallies like those seen last week, only for stocks to resume their decline. To feel confident that the stock market has found a bottom, Kostin and his colleagues say three criteria must be met: The Goldman analysts also warn investors of another headwind for equities going forward: greatly reduced corporate share buybacks. They point out that nearly 50 U.S. corporations have suspended existing share repurchase authorizations in recent weeks, “representing $190 billion in buybacks, or nearly 25% of the 2019 total.” “Buybacks have represented the single largest source of U.S. equity demand in each of the last several years, and we believe higher volatility and lower equity valuations are among the likely consequences of reduced buybacks.” Millions of people are losing their jobs and unemployment is soaring. The mounting devastation to the economy from the coronavirus is becoming starkly visible to households across the nation. Here’s what to watch in the next few weeks as the damage reports come in.

Oil from Alberta has in recent months traded at a large discount compared with WTI, prompting the provincial government to announce plans to order production cuts earlier this week. BoC comments: The loonie has taken it on the chin, trading down at C$1.3393 after the announcement. Markets have a “dovish” take on the BoC stand-pat statement. The statement explaining the rationale behind standing pat, at 1.75%, took on a far more cautious tone compared with previous communications. Governor Stephen Poloz will deliver a speech in Toronto Thursday (08:35 EST), which likely will provide more clues on the central bank’s outlook.

5e955605f6eaee56fed2b221	EUR/USD Forecast: More gradual gains? Europe's cautious coronavirus approach has its advantages	Easter is over – but euro/dollar gains may have room to run. European countries may be sowing the seeds for recovery from coronavirus, and the buds may wake up in the spring. The latest upside driver for EUR/USD comes from China – the world's second-largest economy and where COVID-19 originated has reported better than expected trade balance figures. Both exports and imports beat expectations and lifted the market mood – weighing on the safe-haven dollar. However, the next moves may come from the old continent. France, the eurozone's second-largest economy, has extended the lockdown until May 11 – another four weeks. Nevertheless, French President Emmanuel Macron laid out the contours of a plan to gradually reopen the economy based on being able to tests every person with symptoms. Germany, the continent's locomotive, has reported a significant slowdown in cases while testing remains robust and the envy of many countries. Italy, the epicenter of European COVID-19 cases, remains in lockdown through May 3 and also adopted a cautious approach. Spaniards employed in most non-essential jobs returned to work on Monday with new requirements to wear face masks. The fourth-largest economy saw a sharp fall in infections, yet data may be skewed by reporting issues during the weekend. Overall, the euro area's four largest economies are seeing several encouraging signs and are moving slowly to return to normal. That approach contrasts President Donald Trump's urge to reopen the economy. The leader of the world's largest economy expressed optimism about returning to regular activity ahead of schedule and nominated a seven-strong Council to Re-open America, including his daughter and son-in-law, yet no health officials. Trump also questioned the authority of governors to decide on lockdowns Governors of three Pacific states and a separate group of six East Coast states have formed groups to coordinate reopening the schools and other businesses, apparently ignoring the president. US COVID-19 infections have surpassed 580,000, and deaths are above 23,000. A third of new global coronavirus mortalities are in America. On both sides of the Atlantic, officials fear that relaxing restrictions too early may lead to a resurgence in cases. Apart from the loss of life and pressure on hospitals, a retreat may have devastating economic implications. Asking the public to hunker down for the second time may blow a deadly blow to the confidence of recovery and further slow it. Coronavirus figures from all over the world and speculation about returning to normal are high on the agenda. Global cases have topped 1.9 million, and the death toll is close to 120,000. It is also essential to note that many traders are returning from their holidays, and volatility may increase after several quiet days around the Easter holiday. Euro/dollar is trading within a narrowing uptrend triangle. Both support and resistance lines are rising. The currency pair is trading above the 50 and 100 Simple Moving Averages on the four-hour chart but below the 200 SMA. Momentum is marginal to the upside. Resistance is at Monday's high of 1.0970. It is followed by 1.1110, which is where the 200 SMA hits the price. Further caps are 1.1050 and 1.1090. 1.0930 remains a battleline after holding the pair down in early April and serving as support in late March. The weekly low of 1.0890 provides support, and it is followed by 1.0830 and 1.0770, both working as stepping stones on the way up. More Why stocks are recovering and where next	USD
5e7bfb981147a10757b2d0ac	Dollar dips as investors brace for surge in jobless claims	TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the yen on Thursday before data expected to show a surge in U.S. claims for unemployment benefits as companies lay off workers due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus. The pound extended declines against the euro and the dollar due to lingering worries that Britain is not adequately prepared to deal with an increase in coronavirus cases after the flu-like illness ravaged health care systems in Italy and Spain. The Australian and New Zealand dollars, both of which are closely liked to the global commodity trade, fell against their U.S. counterpart as traders avoided taking on excessive risk. Investors anxiously await the passage of a $2 trillion U.S. stimulus package to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but there are already indications that some U.S. states will need more money for medical supplies as the health care system struggles to cope. “It could be difficult for the markets to digest weekly jobless claims,” said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan markets research at JP Morgan Securities in Tokyo. “Bad numbers are expected and priced in to a certain extent, but there are people who think things will get even worse. In the end this may support the dollar as investors choose to bring their money home.” The dollar fell 0.2% to 110.98 yen JPY=EBS in Asia on Thursday. Against the Swiss franc CHF=EBS, the dollar was little changed at 0.9652. Sterling GBP=D3 fell 0.43% to $1.1831 and fell 0.5% to 92.08 pence per euro EURGBP=D3. The pound’s losses accelerated early in Asian trade after the British government said the total number of coronavirus cases in the UK rose to 9,529 on Wednesday from 8,077 the previous day. U.S. weekly jobless claims due later on Thursday are expected to rise to around a million, which would be well above the previous peak seen during the global financial crisis. Some analysts say jobless claims could even exceed one million as companies are expected to rapidly shed workers. Draconian restrictions on personal movement aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus are widely expected to cause a global recession. Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Senate hoped to vote on Wednesday on a $2 trillion emergency package but found themselves fending off critics from the right and left who threatened to hold up the bill. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to swiftly sign the bill into law, but a Senate vote has yet to be scheduled. The euro EUR=EBS held steady at $1.0846 in Asia on Thursday. The common currency held on to gains against the Swiss franc EURCHF=EBBS, trading at 1.0632. The German lower house on Wednesday suspended the country’s debt brake and approved a debt-financed supplementary budget of 156 billion euros to pay for healthcare and keep companies afloat. The Australian dollar AUD=D3 fell 1% to $0.5905, while the New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 declined by 0.79% to $0.5805. Both the Aussie and the kiwi collapsed to multi-year lows earlier this month as nervous investors liquidated positions in favor of holding their money in the greenback in cash deposits.

5e5d08dc73d82f5acc8afc98	The Dollar’s Short-Term Trend May Be Flipping Following Powell’s Pragmatism	Twice per year, the Chair of the Federal Reserve makes the trek down Constitution Avenue to update Congressional leaders on the state of the US economy. This event, called the Humphrey-Hawkins Testimony after the lawmakers who initially created the requirement back in 1978, offers a longer-term perspective on the outlook for the US economy and is closely watched by traders looking for insight on Federal Reserve policy over the next six months. Unfortunately for those traders, today’s iteration of the testimony offered little in the way of actionable nuggets. Across prepared comments and a Q&A session, Fed Chairman Powell reiterated his cautiously optimistic outlook for the US economy, noted the potentially disruptive impact of coronavirus and climate change, and emphasized the importance of achieving maximum employment, even if it required a temporary overshoot in inflation. Though he suggested that the Fed would gradually transition away from the active use of repo operations (the infamous “not QE”), he noted that the central bank would likely continue such purchases into the second quarter. With Powell opting not to upset the proverbial apple cart, traders saw little reason to tweak their current positions. At the margin, US stock indices did fade from their record intraday highs to trade closer to breakeven levels as we go to press. Meanwhile, the US dollar index also fell to trade lower on the day, even though traders slightly reduced bets on a near-term interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. According to the CME’s FedWatch tool, fed funds futures traders now think an interest rate cut is more likely than not starting with the Fed’s July meeting, whereas traders were pricing in such a move in June yesterday. Source: TradingView, GAIN Capital Looking at the above hourly chart of the dollar index, today’s price action may mark the end of the buck’s recent short-term bullish trend. The index has dropped meaningfully below its 21-hour EMA for the first time since the start of the month, breaking below its rising channel in the process. This price breakdown, combined with the simultaneous break in the MACD indicator below its “0” level, signals that momentum in shifting in favor of the bears, opening the door for a deeper retracement toward the lower-98.00s or 98.00 even later this week. If seen, this bearish move in the greenback could correspond to a rally in EUR/USD toward 1.10 and a drop in USD/JPY toward 109.00.	USD

European and North American Indices all ended up in the red, on currencies the US dollar Index hit its highest level since June 2017 while bond yields in Europe and the US all fell again. The ECB left rates unchanged at 0% but was surprisingly downbeat, slashing Eurozone growth forecasts from 1.70% to 1.10%, lowering inflation forecasts with ECB President Draghi bemoaning “pervasive uncertainty” in the global economy. The ECB launched a new round of cheap bank financing and said it would fully reinvest its maturing bond holdings. With the Euro-zone likely the next target for President Trump’s trade-talk embrace, a slowing economy, a central bank very low on monetary bullets, an inability by members to mount a joint fiscal response and an impending Brexit by the U.K, it is no surprise that the Euro (EUR) fell out of bed. The single currency fell 1% from 1,1305 to 1.1195, a 20-month low. The sombre mood flowed into North America with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones falling 0.8% and the Nasdaq 1.1%. Asia is unlikely to escape Europe’s hangover either following a dismal day on North Asian stock markets yesterday. Local markets will anxiously await China’s trade balance at 1100 am Singapore (USD26.4 exp), followed by German Factory orders (+0.50% exp) before the week’s highlight, the US non-farm payrolls. After last month’s monster 300,000 gain, expectations are more tempered today with the street forecasting 180,000 jobs added. Watch for extensive revisions of the previous months print, with a substantial downward revision potentially holing fragile sentiment below the water line. FX The US dollar reigned supreme overnight as haven flows poured into the greenback and onto US treasuries. The EUR dipped below 1.1200 with the pound (GBP) falling 0.7% to 1.3085. The Australian dollar (AUD), New Zealand dollar (NZD) and Japanese Yen (JPY) all trod water overnight as the news stayed European centric. The China trade data should provide some volatility for all three with sellers emerging on a low print. The same scenario is likely for regional currencies, with traders likely to reduce holdings on a lower print. Local currencies, in particular, are vulnerable to safe-haven outflows ahead of the weekend. Equities Regional stock markets are unlikely to enjoy a happy start to the day with investors likely to see the price action in China, Europe and the US overnight and hit the sell button. We would have expected some lightening of positions anyway ahead of crucial US data and the weekend but overall, the mood will be sombre today. Oil Brent crude and WTI both traded sideways overnight with oil out of the headlights for now. With attention focused elsewhere, oil seems balanced between OPEC cuts and increasing US shale production, at least in the short term. The world talking itself into a recession has the potential to change that balance materially. This article is for general information purposes only.

5e6a5a9fdc4450653eb7605b	Sterling slides as growing coronavirus turmoil boosts dollar	LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling tanked to five-month lows on Thursday, weighed down by worsening market turmoil after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped restrictions on travel from Europe and European Central Bank stimulus measures fell short of expectations. The British currency received a short-lived boost on Wednesday when investors welcomed stimulus measures from the Bank of England and the British government, including an interest rate cut and billions of pounds of support for struggling firms. But the pound has since tumbled, first following Trump’s flight ban and then again as investors scrambled for dollars following the European Central Bank’s decision to keep interest rates on hold. The U.S. flight ban exempts Britain but has been seen as a sign of an escalating crisis. The ECB announcement caused the euro to fall and the dollar to rise as traders rushed to buy the most liquid currency, which tends to do well during market panics. Sterling slid 1.8% to $1.2584, its weakest since October. The pound also fell to 89.12 pence per euro, its lowest level against the single currency since October. “I think of course they (the BoE and UK government) tried to surprise us with the rate cut and a big package. I thought it was well coordinated but I think people are still so scared they don’t want to be long sterling. It still makes sense to be somewhat short sterling,” said Morten Lund, senior FX strategist at Nordea. Analysts at MUFG said in a note that an “aggressive response to combat the coronavirus fallout by UK policymakers has failed to alter the pound’s recent weakening trend”. They added: “The coordinated loosening of fiscal and monetary policy should help to provide more support for the UK economy but is no silver bullet to prevent a sharp slowdown in the coming quarters.” The pound’s fall was mirrored by a slide in stocks in London, with the FTSE 100 index last down nearly 9.5% British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was due to chair an emergency meeting shortly at which he was expected to approve moving to the “delay phase” of the response to the coronavirus including more stringent control measures.

5e5d08dc73d82f5acc8afc94	Bitcoin Quietly Rising from the Ashes - Where to Next?	For many traders, the recent parabolic surge in Tesla evokes a euphoria reminiscent of that surrounding cryptoassets back in late 2017, when Bitcoin peaked near $20,000. As we all know, Bitcoin ultimately collapsed to trade at just $3,200 a year later (though we wouldn’t expect that dramatic of a fall from Tesla, there’s a strong case for more downside if certain support levels are broken). In any event, many traders who wrote off Bitcoin after its -85% drop may want to tune in again. The cryptocurrency has quietly risen from the ashes of despair to triple over the last 13 months. While the rally in price itself is certainly impressive, the most important word in that sentence may be “quietly.” Unlike the heady days in late 2017, when Bitcoin was a daily fixture in traders’ minds and financial media once it broke $10,000, relatively few market participants are even aware that Bitcoin has been rallying, much less obsessing over its day-to-day fluctuations. Attention is notoriously hard to quantify, but using Google Trends search volume as a proxy, we can see that search interest in “bitcoin” was roughly 11 times higher at the peak in late December 2017. More to the point, search interest was already 7 times higher the first time Bitcoin broke above $10,000 in late November 2017: Source: Google Trends, GAIN Capital The relatively low level of retail interest in Bitcoin suggests that we’re nowhere near the mania levels that drove Bitcoin through $10,000 for the first time a little over two years ago. In other words, the formation of another similar bubble (a common occurrence in Bitcoin’s history to date) could lead to the cryptocurrency exceeding its previous record highs near $20,000. While longer-term measures of sentiment remain subdued, the short-term price action suggests that Bitcoin’s rally may be due for a breather. Prices are approaching the highs from August, September, and October of last year in the $10,500-$11,000 range, with the RSI indicator showing signs of stalling out in overbought territory. Source: TradingView, GAIN Capital Given this backdrop, short-term bears could consider sell opportunities below $11,000 for a potential retracement back toward $9,000 or the mid-$8000s. Meanwhile, longer-term bullish traders may want to hold off on new purchases near current levels and wait for a pullback to accumulate more Bitcoin in case we see another bubble form.	BTC
5e6628400fce3e0f538f8aa5	EUR/USD Eyeing Further Bull Pressure Short Term	EUR/USD faces the risk of a further move higher following the second week of price gain in the new week. Resistance comes in at the 1.1350 where a break will turn risk to the 1.1400 level. A breach above here will target the 1.1450 level. Further up, resistance stands at the 1.1500. Conversely, on the downside, support comes in at 1.1250 level with a violation of there opening the door for further gain towards the 1.1200 level. Further down, resistance lies at the 1.1150 level. A cut through that level will clear the way for a move towards the 1.1100 level. All in all, EUR/USD looks for more recovery higher.	USD
5e81b5b6c496d2354de72feb	EU elections not so bad for EUR or GBP	Monday May 27: Five things the markets are talking about Global markets continue to weather some erratic turbulence now that the U.S and China have hit each other with increased tariffs and ended their latest round of trade negotiations without a resolution. But the prices of relatively risky assets have mostly stabilized, and stocks are still within touching distance of their all-time highs. Overnight, equities are small better bid in Europe after a mixed session in Asia as investors contemplate this month’s declines amid escalating Sino-U.S trade tensions. And with a holiday today in the U.S and the U.K market volumes will be seen as much lower. The EUR has rallied in overnight trading as the European parliamentary elections results were much less anti-EU than the market had feared. Established parties lost some ground, while anti-EU and populist parties gained some. However, pro-EU parties hold a fragmented majority of 2/3 of the seats in the next European Parliament. Technically, Eurosceptics will still find it difficult to block decisions unless the centrist pro-European parties fail to cooperate. Elsewhere, sterling has held on to its Friday’s gains. U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond refused to rule out backing a “no-confidence” motion against the government if the next PM tries to force a “no-deal Brexit” on Parliament. Finally, European core government bonds are trading higher in the absence of Treasuries trading. On tap: UK inflation hearings, NZD financial stability report, ANZ Business confidence, RBNZ Gov. Orr speaks (May 28), BoC monetary policy announcement, AUD private capital expenditure & NZD annual budget release (May 29), CH, Fr. & DE bank holiday, US preliminary GDP & CNY manufacturing PMI (May 30), CAD GDP (May 31). 1. Stocks mixed results in holiday trading In Japan, stocks edged higher overnight, on lower volumes, as investors looked-for details from trade talks between the leaders of Japan and United States. The Nikkei share average ended +0.3% higher while the broader Topix added +0.4%. The Nikkei index has lost -5% this month. Down-under, Aussie stocks ended flat as weaker bank stocks offset miners’ gains. The S&P/ASX 200 index closed down -0.06%. Sentiment toward miners was helped by comments from China who said they “would look to keep value-added tax low for the manufacturing industry to boost the economy.” Banks extend losses on warnings of tighter regulations. In S. Korea, the Kospi index ended -0.05% lower for a third straight session on worries the China-U.S trade spat was turning into a technology cold war. In China, equity markets climbed, rebounding from their three-month lows, as investors expected greater policy support to offset impact from U.S tariffs and cooling domestic demand. At the close, the Shanghai Composite index was up +1.4%, while the blue-chip CSI300 index gained +1.2%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng inched -0.24% lower, while the Shenzhen Composite Index, gained +0.15%. In Europe, regional bourses are trading mostly in the green, however, price action remains subdued with both UK and U.S markets closed for holidays. Indices: Stoxx50 +0.4% at 3,362, FTSE closed, DAX +0.4% at 12,064, CAC-40 +0.3% at 5,331, IBEX-35 +0.7% at 9,240, FTSE MIB +0.8% at 20,536, SMI +0.7% at 9,730, S&P 500 Futures +0.1%. 2. Oil under pressure from Sino-U.S trade war, but OPEC provides support Oil prices are trading mixed overnight, with U.S crude under pressure from Sino-U.S trade tensions, while Brent prices have gained some support from OPEC’s+ supply cuts. Spot Brent crude futures are firmer at +$68.82 per barrel, up +13c, or +0.2%, above Friday’s close. While front-month U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures are at +$58.43 per barrel, down -20c, or -0.3%, from Friday. Note: Last week, both crude contracts registered their biggest price declines this year amid concerns that the U.S-China trade dispute could accelerate into a global economic slowdown. Price action remains a ‘push-pull’ trade with the crude ‘bear’ getting a helping hand from slowing demand growth due to the negative impact on the global economy of the Sino-U.S trade war, while the crude ‘bull’ has been relying on escalating political tensions between the U.S and Iran, as well as ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC+. Elsewhere, gold prices have touched a one-week high earlier this morning as fears of a long-drawn-out U.S-China trade war is hurting risk sentiment, while ‘poorer’ economic data from the U.S is supporting fresh bets of a Fed rate cut. Spot gold has edged +0.1% higher to +$1,286.21 per ounce, while U.S gold futures have gained +0.2%, to +$1,285.60 an ounce. 3. Spain, France and Portugal yields trade atop record lows Spanish, French and Portuguese bond yields are trading atop their record lows after the EU parliamentary election results showed pro-EU parties retained a strong majority, reinforcing investor sentiment. Despite nationalist and far-right parties significant gains, they are not as large as had been feared by risk-averse investors. Spanish 10-year bond yields are just above +0.82% while the Portuguese equivalent is at +0.976%. While in France, the 10-year OAT yield has dipped less than -1 bps to +0.278%, the lowest in more than two-years. Elsewhere, the gap between Italian and German bond yields narrowed to its lowest in over two weeks. The spread has tightened to +264 bps in early European trade, the lowest since May 9. Despite the far-right and nationalist parties making strong gains in the vote, German 10-year Bund yields remains anchored at -0.118%, close to three-year low print in mid-May. 4. Turkeys central bank ups FX reserve requirements The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has tweaked its reserve requirements, a form of “backdoor tightening” aimed at helping the TRY. It has increased reserve-requirement ratios for foreign currency deposits/participation funds by +200 bps for all maturity brackets, in order to support financial stability. Effectively, this takes liquidity out of the market. Note: Policymakers have been reluctant to raise interest rates, with the rerun of the Istanbul election looming and the economy hindered by a recession. TRY is trading +0.5% higher at $6.0053. EUR/USD (€1.1194) is steady but holding below the €1.12 level as markets assess the results of the EU parliament election. European parliamentary elections were much less anti-EU than feared but the pro-European camp was becoming more fragmented. GBP/USD (£1.2704) is also steady with UK markets out for a bank holiday. More contenders have appeared to join the race for the upcoming Tory leadership challenge. The USD/CNH has fallen for a third consecutive day after one of China’s senior-most economic officials said that “speculators who intended to go short the yuan will inevitably suffer from a huge loss.” The comments came as US/CNH hit the highest level this year last week, nearing the key ¥7.0 level. The FX pair is now at ¥6.9063, down -0.62% from last week’s high. 5. Swiss employment rose solidly in Q1 Data this morning showed that Switzerland’s employment rose in Q1, which suggests that consumer confidence should stay supported. According to the statistics office, total employment rose +1.3% on-year and job vacancies climbed more than +9%. Swiss unemployment is already “super-low,” and the key question is whether consumers will actually spend. Switzerland’s economy is heavily dependent on foreign trade, and according to analysts, if Swiss consumers boost spending, GDP should expand solidly.

5e81b629c496d2354de73054	Dollar loses its luster, more to come	Thursday January 10: Five things the markets are talking about Global equities took a time-out overnight, ending a four-day rally as investor optimism over a possible easing in Sino-U.S trade tensions faded and concerns around global economic growth returned. Capital markets were probably too optimistic that some concessions would be announced at the end of three-day trade talks this week between the world’s two largest economies – investors seem to prefer to wait for concrete details in the negotiations before mapping out the next leg of investments. The dollar is steady, while crude oil prices have pulled back a tad after climbing above +$52 a barrel and entering a bull market. U.S Treasuries are leading a broad advance in sovereign bonds. Aside from trade negotiations, investors will be watching closely as Fed Chair Powell gives a speech at the Economic Club of Washington this afternoon (12:45pm EST). The market is looking for signs that the Fed will pause or significantly reduce its cycle of rate increases this year. Thus far, there are no signals of a Fed U-turn on interest rates, but market pressure is mounting. U.S policy makers to date have been less data dependent, and more agile in order to respond swiftly to changing conditions. Note: Minutes from the Fed’s Dec.18-19 meeting revealed that several U.S policymakers were in favour of keeping rates steady this year. Domestically, the ongoing partial U.S government shutdown is also weighing on market sentiment ahead of earnings season and coupled with China’s disappointing inflation data overnight, investors have a right to be worried about slowing growth in the world’s second-biggest economy. On tap: The U.K Parliament resumes a debate on the Brexit withdrawal bill – a vote is set for the week of Jan. 14. 1. Stocks see ‘red’ In Japan, the Nikkei’s three-day winning streak came to an end overnight on profit taking as the yen (¥108.09) firmed. After rallying just over +4% in the last three-days, the Nikkei share average ended -1.3% lower, while the broader Topix dropped -0.9%. Down-under, an afternoon rebound allowed the Aussie stock benchmark to finish higher, giving the S&P/ASX 200 its fourth-straight gain. The index rose +0.3% – digging deeper, commodities and utilities rallied +0.8%, while consumer staples lost -2%. In S. Korea, the Kospi edged down -0.7% ahead of Thursday’s expiration of options contracts. In China, equities shed their earlier gains to end lower overnight on worries about sluggish domestic economic growth, while the enthusiasm over the Sino-U.S trade negotiations and policy support faded. At the close, the Shanghai Composite index fell -0.4%, while the blue-chip CSI300 index was down -0.2%. An outlier was Hong Kong equities, stocks rallied for the fifth consecutive session, as a cautious Fed and a firmer yuan lifted market sentiment. At the close of trade, the Hang Seng index was up +0.2%, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises index rose +0.4%. In Europe, regional bourses trade mostly lower on profit taking following on from weakness in Asia and lower U.S futures. U.S stocks are set to open in the ‘red’ (-0.43%). Indices: Stoxx600 -0.26% at 346.78, FTSE -0.17% at 6,894.75, DAX -0.36% at 10,854.07, CAC-40 -0.69% at 4,780.18, IBEX-35 +0.27% at 8,847.00, FTSE MIB +0.08% at 19,194.50, SMI +0.07% at 8,682.80, S&P 500 Futures -0.43% 2. Oil falls on U.S-China trade talks and U.S supply surge, gold higher Oil prices fell more than -1% overnight due to the lack of clear guidance from the Sino-U.S trade talks and on data that again indicated an increase in fuel stocks stateside. Brent crude futures are down -1.3%, or -79c, at +$60.65 per barrel, while U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil futures are at +$51.66 per barrel, down -70c, or -1.2%, from Wednesday’s close. Note: Both benchmarks rallied +5% Tuesday, capping off a weeklong climb that marked oil’s longest non-stop rally since last summer. A number of analysts have begun to cut their 2019 oil price forecasts by more than -10% this week, citing weaker economic growth expectations and rising oil supply, especially from the U.S. Consensus now expects Brent to average around +$61 a barrel this year, down from a previous estimate of +$69, and U.S crude to average +$54, against a previous forecast of +$60. Note: The main source of new supply is the U.S – according to EIA data, crude oil production stateside remains at a record +11.7M bpd in the week ended Jan. 4 and is leading to record fuel inventories. Crude oil prices have been receiving support from supply cuts that started at the end of last year by OPEC+. However, to balance the market would require OPEC discipline to continue well into next year. Ahead of the U.S open, gold prices have found support as growing expectations that the Fed will pause its rate tightening cycle this year and an impasse between President Trump and Democrats on funding for a border wall is weighing on the dollar. Spot gold is up +0.2% at +$1,295.83 per ounce, atop of last Friday’s peak of +$1,298.42. U.S gold futures have gained +0.4% to +$1,297.20 per ounce. 3. Europe takes down a record supply of product Eurozone sovereign bond yields are a tad lower with the overall minor moves indicating that the market was able to take down this weeks record supply with some ease – syndicated supply came from Slovenia, Belgium, Portugal, Ireland. The 10-year German Bund yield is trading at +0.20%, down -1 bps, while the French 10-year OAT yield is down -0.6 bps at +0.70%. Italy will round off this week’s record issuance tomorrow, Friday. Yesterday’s FOMC December minutes highlighted that officials expressed less certainty about the “timing and size” of future rate increases. Many Fed Members believed they could afford to be patient about further policy tightening given muted inflation pressures of last month meeting, with a few noting that they “should assess impact of risks that had become more pronounced in recent months.” The yield on U.S 10-year Treasuries fell -3 bps to +2.68%, the largest fall in a week, while in the U.K, the 10-year Gilt yield fell -4 bps to +1.226%, the lowest in a week on the largest tumble in more than a week. 4. Dollar looking for consistency The ‘mighty’ USD began this mornings E.U session on the softer side on rising bets that the Fed would soon implement a ‘pause’ in the current tightening cycle or significantly reduce its pace of rate increases this year. Investors continue to look for clarity – will Fed Chair Powell provide some color at today’s talks at the Economic Club in Washington (12:45 EST)? EUR/USD (€1.1525) trades atop of its highest levels in a couple of months. Earlier in today’s session dealers witnessed a EUR ‘short squeeze’ to a nine-day high print of €1.1571. The longer the single unit stays above the psychological €1.15 handle, the techies seem more confident that they will a €1.1620 print in the short-term. Overnight, China guided the yuan to its strongest level outright since late August. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) fixed the midpoint for trading at ¥6.8160/dollar, compared with ¥6.8526 Wednesday. The USD ended ‘onshore’ Chinese trading yesterday at ¥6.8330. GBP/USD is lower by -0.2% at £1.2760 area as PM May seeks EU assurances on the backstop provision. Last night, the UK government lost a second consecutive vote –an amendment to the withdrawal agreement which changed the time PM May has to come back with a plan B in the event of a defeat next week. Previously it was 21-days, it’s now 3 and had support from 20 Tory rebels again. 5. China’s sluggish prices raise deflation fears Data overnight from China showed that both consumer and producer prices ‘decelerated’ sharply last month, making it even harder for authorities to improve a “sluggish demand in a deepening economic downturn.” Consumer prices rose in December at their slowest pace in six-months, +1.9% y/y, while prices charged by producers increased by the lowest rate in 24-months, at +0.9%. The disappointing headline prints have many raising the alarm about the rising risk of deflation in the Chinese economy. Other weaker recent data, such as factory orders, retail sales and exports, point to a slowing economy, which puts more pressure on Beijing to resolve their trade fight with the U.S sooner rather than later.

5e738f910c13186ab6a5c9bf	Bank of England cuts rates again and ramps up bond buying to combat coronavirus impact	The Bank of England (BOE) cut interest rates to 0.1% and ratcheted up its bond-buying program Thursday, in an effort to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. At an emergency meeting, the central bank’s monetary policy committee voted unanimously to lower borrowing costs by 15 basis points and to increase the BOE’s bond-buying program to £645 billion ($752 billion), up £200 billion. The BOE had previously cut rates to 0.25% from 0.75% on March 11. It said the majority of additional asset purchases would comprise of U.K. government bonds and would be completed “as soon as is operationally possible.” The move follows in the footsteps of several other central banks worldwide, with many taking bold steps to hike their stimulus measures in order to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Sterling rose on the news, climbing almost 1.4% to reach $1.1770 Thursday afternoon. The U.K. currency had collapsed to a 35-year low Wednesday. “Over recent days, and in common with a number of other advanced economy bond markets, conditions in the U.K. gilt market have deteriorated as investors have sought shorter-dated instruments that are closer substitutes for highly liquid central bank reserves,” the BOE said. “As a consequence, U.K. and global financial conditions have tightened,” it added. To date, the U.K. has 2,644 cases of the coronavirus nationwide, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The U.K.’s National Health Service reported a further 29 people had died Thursday, taking the country’s death toll up to 128. “The spread of Covid-19 and the measures being taken to contain the virus will result in an economic shock that could be sharp and large, but should be temporary,” the bank said in a statement. The next regularly scheduled BOE meeting will take place on March 26, with the minutes set to be published the following day. On Tuesday, the U.K.’s finance minister announced a £330 billion ($398 billion) aid package of loans for businesses, as well as a business rates holiday and grants. Finance Minister Rishi Sunak said the government would “support jobs ... support incomes and we will support businesses ... we will do whatever it takes,” he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has since announced schools in England will shut from Friday. Speaking at the government’s daily press conference Wednesday, Johnson said: “They will remain closed for the vast majority of pupils until further notice.” Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland will also close their schools from Friday. All schools and colleges in the Republic of Ireland have been closed, too.	GBP
5e85940102de227524d97232	Canadian artist dumped after his ‘Pulitzer Prize–worthy’ cartoon of Trump golfing next to dead migrants goes viral	This cartoon apparently wasn’t fit to print in New Brunswick, Canada, and it reportedly cost Michael de Adder his job after the internet got hold of it. As you can see, de Adder turned the heartbreaking photo of a father and daughter who died trying to cross the Rio Grande into a cartoon slamming Trump for his perceived indifference to the plight of the migrants at the southern border. “I *literally* gasped audibly when I saw this cartoon,” one Twitter TWTR, -1.28% follower replied, capturing the general sentiment across social media toward the illustration. “My husband & children heard & wanted to know what was wrong. I almost couldn’t speak to respond. It was that painfully true.” Actor Mark Hamill chimed in, calling the cartoon “Pulitzer Prize–worthy.” While it was clearly a viral hit, the cartoon didn’t go over too well with the people signing the checks, according to de Adder: Wes Tyrell, president of the Association of Canadian Cartoonists, claimed in a Facebook FB, -0.88% post that there’s more going on here with the J.D. Irving–owned Brunswick News Inc. than just a controversial cartoon. “The Irvings have considerable corporate interests in the United States, but why would they care about cartoons potentially offending the American president?” Tyrell wrote. “Trade has been an issue since Trump took office, trade that affects the Irvings directly, not to mention a host of other issues. And the President himself is an unknown quantity who punishes those who appear to oppose him.” The Brunswick News admitted terminating de Adder’s contract but denied the cartoon was the cause. “This is a false narrative which has emerged carelessly and recklessly on social media,” BNI said in a statement Sunday. “In fact, BNI was not even offered this cartoon by Mr. de Adder. The decision to bring back reader favourite Greg Perry was made long before this cartoon, and negotiations had been ongoing for weeks.” Meanwhile, de Adder is still at it: Lenders are still waiting on final rules from the U.S. government to help get its $350 billion rescue lending programs off the ground on Friday to shore up small businesses battered by the coronavirus pandemic.

5e797e0b9c49450da027877b	Dollar slips as Fed's money bazooka loosens tight cash supply	TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar slipped on Tuesday on signs tight funding conditions are easing slightly after the U.S. Federal Reserve pulled out all stops to supply much needed greenback liquidity. The Fed announced unlimited quantitative easing and programs to support credit markets on Monday in a drastic bid to backstop an economy reeling from emergency restrictions on commerce to fight the coronavirus. “We seem to have got out of a phase where everything from stocks to safe assets such as bonds and gold were sold,” said Koichi Kobayashi, chief manager of forex at Mitsubishi Trust Bank. “The dollar funding conditions are easing slightly, compared with a week ago, though I wouldn’t say things are normal. While the Fed is pumping dollars, we still need to wait and see if those money will flows to every corner of the economy.” The dollar index =USD lost about 0.5% to 101.64, slipping further from Friday’s peak of 102.99, its highest level since January 2017. Against the yen, the dollar shed 1% to 110.19 yen JPY=, having hit a one-month high of 111.59 in the previous session. The euro gained 0.8% to $1.0810 EUR=, bouncing back from a near three-year low of $1.0636 in the previous session. The British pound also rose 0.8% to $1.1650 GBP=D4, up more than two cents from its 35-year low of $1.1413 set last week. The Fed, which has already expanded its balance sheet to a record level, undertook unprecedented measures to extend its “lender of last resort” power beyond Wall Street to Main Street and City Hall. It announced various programs including purchases of corporate bonds, guarantees for direct loans to companies and a plan to get credit to small and medium-sized business. The radical steps came after U.S. money markets seized up as a broad set of market participants, from big multinational carmakers to small shop owners, hoarded dollars fearing a slump in cashflow during lockdowns in their countries. While the Fed’s move is likely to mitigate the blow for many companies in the long-run, investors remained on edge amid uncertainty about the extent of the pandemic. Coronavirus cases continued to rise exponentially in many countries, raising worries about the lack of hospital beds in some areas. Wall Street’s slide deepened on Monday as the rapidly spreading coronavirus forced more U.S. states into lockdown while Washington’s fiscal stimulus package remained stalled in the Senate. “The market is still nervous about possible moves to cash everything, including unwinding of existing derivative positions,” said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale. The three-month dollar/yen currency basis swap spread, seen as the market premium demanded for swapping yen for dollar, stood at 0.80% JPYCBS3M=TKFX, down from a peak of around 1.4% last week but still far above normal levels around 0.2-0.4%. Trading remained volatile, with the Australian dollar rising 1.8% to $0.5932 AUD=D4, extending its recovery from a 17-year low of $0.5510 touched last week. The Mexican peso MXN=D4 and the South African rand ZAR=D4 jumped more than 1% and many emerging market currencies gained too. Market players are looking to a raft of business sentiment surveys in Europe due later in the day for a glimpse of how the virus is affecting the real economy.

5e5dda86d0d0eb35e0a18943	The RBA Cuts Rates and Supports the Expectation of a Coordinated Global Response	It was a relatively busy day on the Asian economic calendar this morning. The Aussie Dollar was in action this morning. While the stats were in focus, the RBA was also in action this morning. With talk of central banks stepping in to soften the blow of the coronavirus on the global economy, there was plenty of interest… On the economic data front, January building approvals and the current account were in focus in the early part of the session. Building approvals slumped by 15.3% in January, following on from a 0.2% decline from December. Economists had forecast a 1% increase. According to the ABS, In the 4th quarter, the current account surplus narrowed from an A$7.9bn surplus to an A$1.0bn surplus. Economists had forecast a surplus of A$2.3bn. The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.65388 to $0.65327 upon release of the figures that preceded the RBA monetary policy decision and rate statement. Later in the morning, the RBA cut interest rates from 0.75% to 0.50%. While this was not in line with economist forecasts, chatter had built on Monday of expectations of a coordinated central bank move across the major economies to soften the blow of the coronavirus. Salient points from the RBA Statement included: The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.65279 to a high $0.65657 upon release of the rate statement. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was up by 0.26% to $0.6554. At the time of writing, the Japanese Yen was up by 0.37% to ¥107.93 against the U.S Dollar, with the Kiwi Dollar up by 0.18% to $0.6272. It’s a relatively busy day ahead on the economic calendar. Key stats include prelim Eurozone inflation figures for February and January’s unemployment rate. While the stats are of interest, sentiment towards monetary policy will continue to be the key driver. The markets are looking for a GFC style coordinated central bank response to the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy. For the Eurozone and the EUR, there was a double boost on Monday, with chatter of fiscal policy support from Germany also anticipated. This assuming, of course, that Germany delivers and Banks don’t sit it out for another month… At the time of writing, the EUR was up by 0.05% at $1.1140. It’s a relatively quiet day ahead on the economic calendar. February Construction PMI is due out this afternoon. Forecasts are Sterling negative, which could sink the Pound to sub-$1.27 levels as talks between the EU and Britain proceed. On the monetary policy front, the BoE may be off the hook this time around, which could give the Pound some much-needed near-term support. At the time of writing, the Pound was up by 0.20% to $1.2779. It’s a quiet day ahead on the U.S economic calendar. There are no material stats due out of the U.S to provide the Greenback with direction. The lack of stats will leave sentiment towards monetary policy as the key driver on the day. The markets will be looking for an indication of when the FED will deliver… On the geopolitical front, it’s also Super Tuesday, with 34% of delegates up for grabs as the Democratic leadership race heats up. Following Biden’s South Carolina victory from the weekend and Buttigieg dropping out, there’s a lot more to play for. Sanders, Bloomberg, and Elizabeth Warren will also be looking to give Bernie Sanders more to think about… The Dollar Spot Index was up by 0.14% to 97.493 at the time of writing. It’s another quiet day ahead on the economic calendar, with no material stats to provide direction. Central bank support is anticipated this week to ease market angst. We saw the Loonie bounce back to C$1.33 levels, with crude oil prices on the rise. Easing by the BoC on Wednesday, with a dovish outlook could reverse early gains, however. Unlike the RBA, the BoC was on a more dovish footing the last time around… The Loonie was down by 0.01% at C$1.3329 against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing.	AUD
5e9583bf4bab9243f561947a	China’s GDP growth to hit 44-year low of 2.5% in 2020 due to coronavirus – Reuters poll	According to a median of 62 analysts surveyed by Reuters, China’s economy is likely to expand at the slowest annual pace in over four decades this year, in light of the coronavirus pandemic induced economic disruptions. “Growth in the world’s second-biggest economy for 2020 was forecast at 2.5% This would mark the weakest clip since 1976, the final year of the decade-long Cultural Revolution that wrecked the economy. That is a sharp easing from a 6.1% gain in 2019, and is below the 5.4% growth forecast in the March poll. The survey also predicted China’s economy in the first quarter will contract by 6.5% year-on-year, for the first time since at least 1992 when the country first started issuing quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) data. It also marks a reversal from 3.5% growth forecast in the last survey done in the previous month. Analysts expect the PBOC to deliver another 100 basis points (bps) in banks’ reserve retirement ratios (RRR), and lower the one-year LPR by 35 bps to 3.70% by the end of 2020. The benchmark deposit rate is also likely to be cut to 1.25% from its current level of 1.50%. China’s consumer price index (CPI) in 2020 will likely rise 3.3% from the previous year, quickening from a 2.9% rise in 2019.”	CNH
5e5d08052e1fe5553d2b63ca	Brexit Woes Weigh on Aussie, Kiwi; Yen Pressured by Trade Deal Hope	The Asia Pacific currencies finished lower last week, pressured by rising U.S. Treasury yields and increased demand for higher risk assets. Fundamentally, investors were rattled by new uncertainties over Brexit, which raised enough concerns to offset any positive developments over U.S.-China trade relations. Domestically, central bank concerns dominated the trade ahead of this week’s Bank of Japan (BOJ) policy decision, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s (RBNZ) expected rate hike in November and future loosening by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Early in the week, fresh Brexit worries drove safe-haven demand for the Japanese Yen, while pressuring the Aussie and Kiwi. The new concerns were raised after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was thwarted by a cross-party group of politicians in Parliament who voted to postpone the “meaningful vote” on his new Brexit deal. Later in the week, U.K. lawmakers voted to reject a limited time frame for reviewing legislation related to Britain’s withdrawal from the EU. It now means that the U.K. is almost certainly not going to leave the U.K. on October 31 – the current deadline, and the EU may provide an extension to prevent a no-deal occurring. Offsetting the fresh concerns over Brexit was an improvement in investor sentiment around ongoing negotiations between the United States and China. The Australian Dollar started the week higher, but a reversal to the downside on October 22 ignited a three day sell-off. “The AUD is now likely to be driven more by the domestic economic outlook and relative monetary policy trends and less by the global risk factors such as equities. Our expectations are for the RBA to remain dovish but we also expect a deep cutting cycle from the Fed,” says Vassili Serebriakov, a strategist at UBS, in a research note. The AUD/USD settled at .6821, down 0.0035 or -0.51%. For weeks, the New Zealand Dollar traded higher as investors increased bets on a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut at the end of October. However, expectations of another rate cut in December likely means the RBNZ will be forced to cut rates in November in order to protect the economy by keeping the Kiwi weak. The Fed’s next meeting is on October 29-30 and investors have almost priced in a 25-basis point cut in the Fed Funds Rate to between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent. The markets have also fully priced in a 25 basis point rate cut to 0.75 percent by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand when its monetary policy committee next meets on November 13 but are pushing out further cuts. Last week, the NZD/USD settled at .6350, down 0.0036 or -0.56%. According to Reuters, the Bank of Japan is leaning toward keeping monetary policy steady next week as stable markets, a truce in U.S.-China trade talks and robust domestic demand give it room to save it dwindling ammunition to battle the next recession, sources said. Last week, the USD/JPY settled at 108.674, up 0.266 or +0.25%. U.S. equities rose last week as investors cheered strong quarterly earnings and apparent progress on the U.S.-China trade front. This helped make the safe-haven Japanese Yen a less-desirable investment.	GBP
5e6f91a3c0d1010a982ed5ca	EUR/USD Trading Strategies: 03_16_20	The daily chart of the EUR/USD Forex market had a big rally and then 4 big bear days. Big Up, Big Down creates Big Confusion. That typically results in a trading range. I said last week at the top of the buy climax that there would a 50% pullback to the EMA, the January 31 breakout point, and the March 3 buy climax low. Last week’s selloff reached those targets and therefore the bears will take profits. The bulls expect a 2nd leg sideways to up after their strong 2 week rally, but they want to make sure the selling has ended. They will wait for a 2nd reversal up. The bears expect a 2nd leg down from their strong selloff. Therefore, traders should expect sellers not far above Friday’s high. The 5-minute chart of the EUR/USD Forex market tested Friday’s low overnight and reversed up. It broke above Friday’s high and pulled back. This is trading range price action. Traders are betting that the 4-day bear trend will not get too far and that it is too early for the 2-week bull trend to resume. They are expecting reversals and a buying selloffs and selling rallies. The overnight reversal was probably strong enough to that the overnight low will hold. However, it was not strong enough to make a big break above Friday’s high likely. Traders expect a limit order market on the daily chart (reversals instead of breakouts). That usually results in lots of reversals on the 5-minute chart. The legs up and down for scalpers to make 20 – 30 pip scalps. Unless there is a surprise breakout up or down today, day traders will continue to scalp.	USD
5e81b629c496d2354de73050	Dollar supported by U.S trade optimism	Friday January 18: Five things the markets are talking about Improved market and investor optimism for Sino-U.S trade talks saw global equities and U.S stock futures climb in the overnight session. In commodities, crude oil prices are leading the rally, while sovereign yields back up and safe have currencies, like the yen, edge lower on suggestions that the U.S is considering reducing some tariffs on China during the negotiations as a way of getting more in return. There were reports overnight suggesting that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was in favor to ease China tariffs. Even though the U.S Treasury denied the reports, the fact that the idea was floated has many believing that the Trump administration is keen for trade solution sooner rather than later to aid financial markets. More Fed ‘dovish’ rhetoric mid-week from Chicago Fed Evans has also aided-risk on trading as we close out the week. His views about being patient on further interest-rate increases, resonates with messages from his colleagues and is helping equities to close out their fourth weekly consecutive gain. On tap: Canadian CPI (08:30 am EDT). 1. Stocks get the green light The Nikkei rallied +1.5% this week, nearly all of it in the overnight session (+1.3%), helped mostly by the currency markets (¥109.58) as capital markets take solace in Sion-U.S trade hopes. The broader Topix rose +0.9%, with all but two of the indexes 33 subsectors trading in the ‘black.’ Down-under, Aussie stocks maintained their steady gains throughout the overnight session, which allowed the index to record its first consecutive weekly gains in eight-weeks. The ASX 200 rallied +0.5% and +1.8% for the week. In South Korean, equities pushed to session highs at day’s close, capping its second consecutive week higher. The Kospi climbed +0.8%, to trade atop of December’s high print. It rose +2.4% for the week. In China and Hong Kong, the equity story was the same. Stocks got a boost on higher hopes for a resolution to the U.S-China trade war. In China, the Shanghai Composite Index rose +1.42%, while the CSI 300 of blue-chips closed up +1.8% – both benchmarks were up for their third straight week and saw their biggest weekly gains in two-months. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index climbed +1.25%, to close the week at the highest level so far this year, and it’s up +5% in 2019. In Europe, regional bourses trade higher across the board gains in Asia and strong U.S futures on positive trade sentiment. U.S stocks are set to open in the ‘black’ (+0.29%). Indices: Stoxx600 +1.0% at 354.2, FTSE +1.04% at 6,906.25, DAX +1.07% at 11,034.10, CAC-40 +1.18% at 4,850.74, IBEX-35 +1.01% at 8,998.60, FTSE MIB +0.65% at 19,596.50, SMI +0.62% at 8,968.70, S&P 500 Futures +0.29% 2. Oil climbs on OPEC output cut and easing trade tensions, gold lower Oil prices have rallied over +1% overnight after an OPEC+ report showed its production levels fell sharply last month, easing fears about prolonged oversupply. Also aiding crude prices is trade related optimism. Brent crude futures are up +62c, or +1.01% at +$61.80 per barrel – Brent has rallied +2% this week, its third consecutive week of gains, while U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is at +$52.65 per barrel, up +58c, or +1.11% from Thursday’s close. OPEC+ indicated yesterday that they had cut oil output sharply in December 2018 before a new accord to limit supply took effect on Jan. 1. This would suggest that the main producers have made a strong start to avoid creating a supply glut in 2019. In its monthly report, OPEC’s oil output fell by -751K bpd in December to +31.58M bpd, the biggest month-on-month drop in 24-months. Note: The combination of production cuts by OPEC+, especially the Saudis, and tightening sanctions on Iranian oil exports is bringing the market close to equilibrium. OPEC has cut its forecast for daily demand this year to +30.83M bpd, down -910K bpd from last year’s average. Also, a surge in U.S crude output is undermining most of OPEC’s efforts – U.S output has increased by more than +2M bpd in the last 12-months to +11.9M bpd. In commodities, palladium is holding above +$1,400 ($1,419) an ounce ahead of the U.S open after surging to record levels ($1,434.50) yesterday, amid tight supplies, while gold prices have eased as risk sentiment gets a leg-up from hopes of progress in U.S-China trade talks. Spot gold is down -0.1% at +$1,290.51 per ounce, while U.S gold futures are down -0.2% at +$1,290 per ounce. 3. Bund yields hit four-week high on “soft” Brexit hopes In Friday’s Euro session, German Bund yields have backed up to a one-month high on renewed hopes that the U.K could avoid a messy divorce from the E.U, and perhaps hold a second referendum, raising the prospect of “no” Brexit at all. Also pushing yields higher are hopes of a more constructive stance in the Sino-U.S. trade talks. German 10-year Bund yields have rallied to a near one-month high of +0.255%, up +3 bps on the day and nearly +9 bps this week; its first weekly rise since early November. Most of the other eurozone bond yields are also +2 to +3 bps higher ahead of the U.S open. Elsewhere, the yield on 10-year Treasuries has gained less than +1 bps to +2.76%, reaching the highest in more than three-weeks on its fifth straight advance. 4. Big dollar supported by trade optimism The Euro FX session has been very quiet with no new news out on Brexit and limited economic data releases. Improved risk sentiment, backed by positive Sino-U.S trade suggestions, has the USD poised for its first weekly gain in four-weeks, backed by rate differentials – Fixed income dealers have been pricing out the ability of other G7 central banks to start raising interest rates this year. GBP/USD (£1.2944) heads into the U.S session giving up some of its late gains. Dealers believe that the Brexit process had pivoted toward a “softer” Brexit which has been supporting the pound over the past few sessions. Techies see £1.2800 level as strong support for the time being and £1.3000 as the psychological resistance. EUR/USD (€1.1404) continues to be locked into its €1.13-1.15 range for the time being and caught between the Fed’s recent rhetoric of reaffirmed “patience” and concerns that the Eurozone might have slipped into a technical recession. Optimism on the Sino-U.S trade front has helped to unwind a percentage of the safe-haven trades and put pressure on the Japanese Yen. USD/JPY higher by +0.3% at ¥109.55 5. U.K retail sales fall in December Data this morning from the ONS shows that U.K retail sales declined last month, adding to signs the economy slowed in Q4, 2018. U.K retail sales fell -0.9% in December m/m – the slide follows strong sales growth in November (+1.3%), suggesting that “Black Friday” sales encouraged consumers to bring forward their usual Christmas purchases. Today’s print can be offered as the latest evidence that the British economy lost steam in the final three months of last year. Economists say tighter credit conditions and uncertainty over the U.K.’s future ties to the E.U are hurting both consumer and business confidence.

5e5d08eebd5d9d5ac07275f8	USD Forecast: US Dollar Drops on Fed Cuts, Consumer Confidence Eyed	A wave of risk-aversion plagued markets on Monday as fear of the novel coronavirus outbreak and its impact on economic growth festered over the weekend. While worsening market sentiment frequently bolsters USD price action, which is largely due to the Greenback’s posturing as the premier safe-haven currency, the US Dollar nevertheless extended Friday’s plunge. Another bulge in Fed interest rate cut expectations and deeper Treasury yield curve inversion likely underpin recent weakness in the US Dollar Index. Measured via the DXY Index, the broader US Dollar is now trading more than 0.5% below the February 20 intraday swing high of 99.91 – the strongest reading in nearly three years. In addition to the latest coronavirus headlines, upcoming consumer confidence data slated for release Tuesday, February 25 at 15:00 GMT has potential to weigh considerably on USD price action as well. The headline US consumer confidence figure for February 2020 is expected to cross the wires with a reading of 132.1 and compares to the prior period’s reading of 131.6. It is noteworthy, however, that consumer confidence could be understated due to the time-lag of the report; the preliminary survey data release only includes responses received by the 18th of the month. As such, the upcoming consumer confidence report will largely overlook the abrupt return of coronavirus concerns and corresponding plunge in stocks over the last few days. This could place greater credence on changes in the underlying consumer confidence index components – future expectations and current conditions. Nevertheless, recent US Dollar selling pressure might be exacerbated by a worse-than-expected consumer confidence report. This is seeing that deteriorating consumer confidence could encourage the Federal Reserve to discard its neutral monetary policy stance conveyed out of the January Fed meeting. In lieu of keeping rates on hold this year, the Fed may capitulate to FOMC interest rate cut expectations currently being priced in – likely as insurance against downside risks stemming from the coronavirus outbreak – if consumer confidence shows signs of material degradation. Since the beginning of February,interest rate traders have priced in an additional 15-basis points of cuts from the Fed by next year according to the latest overnight swaps data. A full quarter-point interest rate cut from the Fed is now expected by June 2020. Lofty Fed rate cut bets now being priced in to combat rekindled recession odds and an inverted yield curve have potential of unwinding, however, and could send the US Dollar quickly snapping back higher. This development would likely come in response to robust consumer confidence data or improving risk appetite.

5e8133d99074743fe870a2d9	Australia stocks surge 7% as investors assess economic impact of coronavirus pandemic	Stocks in major Asia Pacific markets were mixed on Monday as investors continue to assess the economic impact of the global coronavirus pandemic that continues to spread rapidly. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 led gains among the region’s major markets as it surged 7% to close at 5,181.40, with the heavily weighted financial subindex up 8.8% as shares of the country’s so-called Big Four banks soared: Australia and New Zealand Banking Group added 8.47%, Commonwealth Bank of Australia rose 10.91%, Westpac advanced 8.53% while National Australia Bank gained 7.87%. Elsewhere, the Nikkei 225 in Japan fell 1.57% to close at 19,084.97 as shares of index heavyweight and conglomerate Softbank Group dropped 4.99% while the Topix index slipped 1.64% to end its trading day at 1,435.54. Fujifilm’s stock, on the other hand, jumped 5.98%. The moves came after the Nikkei Asian Review reported over the weekend that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government will start trial procedures aimed at winning approval for an anti-flu drug developed by the company as a treatment for the coronavirus. Mainland Chinese stocks were lower on the day, with the Shanghai composite down 0.9% to around 2,747.21 while the Shenzhen composite shed 2.114% to about 1,657.55. The Shenzhen component declined 2.03% to 9,904.95. Over in South Korea, the Kospi finished its trading day just below the flatline at 1,717.12 while the Kosdaq index jumped 3.69% to close at 542.11. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong declined 1.04%, as of its final hour of trading. Overall, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index was 0.3% lower. Investors continue to watch for developments on the global coronavirus outbreak, which has already infected more than 720,000 worldwide and taken at least 33,925 lives, according to the latest data compiled by John Hopkins University. Markets have been volatile in recent weeks, seeing sharp movements in both directions as authorities across the globe announced vast amounts of stimulus to stem the economic impact of the virus. “The big question for markets is whether the huge stimulus introduced so far across the globe will be enough to help the global economy withstand the economic shock from the COVID-19 containment measures,” Rodrigo Catril, a currency strategist at National Australia Bank, wrote in a note. “To answer this question one needs to know the magnitude of the containment measures and for how long they will be implemented,” Catril said. This was “unknown” at this point, he said, and suggests that markets are “likely to remain volatile” until the uncertainty is resolved. Catril’s view was echoed by Gareth Nicholson, head of fixed income at Bank of Singapore, who told CNBC on Monday that the firm was “still cautious at the moment.” “Until we get some sort of clarity from the virus, it’s very difficult to be ... full risk-on,” Nicholson told CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” Oil prices plunged in the afternoon of Asian hours, with international benchmark Brent crude futures down 6.58% to $23.29 per barrel while U.S. crude futures dropped 4.79% to $20.48 per barrel. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was last at 98.774 after declining from levels above 100 last week. The Japanese yen, often seen as a safe-haven currency, traded at 108.08 per dollar after strengthening from levels above 110 last week. The Australian dollar changed hands at $0.6132 after rising from levels below $0.60 in the previous week. Clarification: This story was updated to reflect that mainland Chinese stocks were lower on Monday morning.	JPY
5e5d07bc203be655205b7adc	Chinese shares lead gains in Asia, Shanghai composite up 1.3%	Asia Pacific markets mostly traded higher on Wednesday, building on gains from the previous session, after stocks sold off recently due to worries over the new coronavirus outbreaks. Chinese shares led gains in the region, with the Shanghai composite up 1.25% to around 2,818.09. The Shenzhen component index rose 2.14% to 10,305.50 and the Shenzhen composite added 2.48% to about 1,678.63. The Chinext start-up board was up more than 3% to around 2,180.29. On Monday, stocks in mainland China had plummeted more than 7% after they returned to trade following an extended holiday as the rapidly spreading pneumonia-like virus spooked investors. Japan’s Nikkei 225 advanced 1.02% to 23,319.56 while the Topix index added 1.04% to 1,701.83. The yen, considered a safe-haven asset in times of market uncertainties, changed hands at 109.42 per dollar, weakening from levels below 108.80 earlier in the week. In South Korea, the Kospi index erased some of its near 1% gains to trade up 0.36% at 2,165.63. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gave up most of its gains of around 0.83% earlier to trade up 0.27%. Australia’s benchmark ASX 200 rose 0.39% to 6,976.10, as the heavily weighted financial subindex gave up earlier gains to finish fractionally lower. Major banking stocks in the country closed mixed, with Commonwealth Bank shares dropping 1.22%. The session in Asia Pacific followed overnight rallies on Wall Street and in Europe. “Markets have now embarked on a new rebound, spurred by China’s efforts to support its economy alongside an apparent decline in concerns over the Coronavirus impact on the global economy,” Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign-exchange strategist at the National Australia Bank, wrote in a morning note. China’s central bank lowered interest rates on reverse repurchase agreements — a tool used by central banks to add money to the money supply — on Monday to ensure adequate liquidity supply in the system as the country tackles to contain the virus outbreak. The People’s Bank of China reduced the 7-day reverse repo rate by 10 basis points from 2.50% to 2.40%, and the 14-day rate was slashed from 2.65% to 2.55%. PBOC injected 1.7 trillion yuan (approx. $242 billion) into money markets through reverse repurchase operations on Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday, the central bank said it decided not to conduct open market operations for the day because there was “adequate liquidity in the current banking system, which is sufficient to meet the market demand.” Still, some economists think the Chinese central bank’s efforts may not be enough to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak that has already killed 490 people in the country. Read: Coronavirus live updates: Death toll in China hits 490, as confirmed cases cross 24,000 The fast-spreading infection is already starting to have an impact on China: travel numbers have declined due to restrictions and quarantines, businesses are feeling the impact from falling demand, and large swathes of the country remain shut, including many factories. “Each day as populations remain quarantined, firms and factories are shuttered and uncertainty remains regarding the spread and severity of the coronavirus, the impacts spread further within China via a number of channels within the economy,” Steve Cochrane, chief Asia Pacific economist at Moody’s Analytics, wrote in a note. Cochrane said that while economic impacts of the virus outbreak will be felt elsewhere in Asia and in the U.S., China will feel the brunt of it. He highlighted five industrial sectors that appear to be most at risk from the coronavirus and the resulting quarantines throughout the country: Transportation and warehouse industry, wholesale and retail trade, commercial real estate, entertainment, and manufacturing. “These five industries combined would reduce first-quarter 2020 GDP by 1.2%, or around 0.3% for the entire year,” Cochrane wrote. “This does not include multiplier effects within other industries, a longer-term loss of confidence, or the longer-term impact on credit availability and credit quality.” South Korea’s Hyundai Motor said on Tuesday it decided to temporarily suspend production assembly lines from operating at all of its plants in the country due to disruptions in the supply of parts from China. Hyundai shares closed flat. In the currency market, the U.S. dollar traded at 98.004 against a basket of peers, climbing from a low of 97.787 in the previous session. The Australian dollar was flat around $0.6738. Oil prices advanced during Asian hours on Wednesday: U.S. crude was up 0.87% at $50.04 a barrel while global benchmark Brent advanced 0.96% to $54.48. OPEC and its allies could cut production by more than a million barrels a day, according to some experts. The producer group is said to likely bring forward a planned policy meeting from March to February, which would underscore the serious worries over a double-digital collapse in the price of oil this year. For the year, U.S. crude is down more than 19% while Brent is lower by 18%, and there are worries that the coronavirus outbreak will significantly curb demand. Moody’s Analytics said in a note that at current prices, “commodity producers will soon begin to cut back on production and investment.”	EQUITY
5e81b5b6c496d2354de72fe1	USD/CAD Canadian Dollar Higher After US and Canadian Jobs Report	The Canadian dollar rose on Friday as employment reports in both countries told different stories. The Canadian jobs data impressed by beating expectations with a 27,700 job gain. The forecasts were lower after a monster April gain of 106,500 and the loonie ended up higher against the greenback as the U.S. non-farm payrolls (NFP) disappointed to the downside. The negative effects of a prolonged trade war with China are starting to appear in the jobs sector. Equities remain on a winning streak as the US and Mexico appear to be near an agreement, but the market is sensitive to escalations on the trade front. Monetary policy divergence is driving part of the gain of the Canadian currency. The Fed was forced to pump the brakes hard in January on monetary policy after four rate hikes in 2018. Now the Fed’s dot-plot is pointing to no rate hikes, and rising probabilities of a rate cut as the US economy is not immune to the negative effects of a trade war. Commodities jumped on dollar softness and other factors. Gold is enjoying a boost from investor appetite for the metal as a safe haven, while oil prices were supported by Russia and Saudi Arabia signalling their willingness to extend the OPEC+ deal. Russia had been non-committal and still hold most of the cards with Saudi Arabia willing to make some concessions, but until an agreement is reached and maybe announced in the meeting between the OPEC and other major producers in June, oil will remain sensitive to trade headlines and increases to US production. Dollar Tumbles as NFP Disappoints and Rate Cut Probabilities Rise The US dollar is down across the board against major pairs. The May employment report shocked with a lower than expected number of new jobs. The US added 75,000 positions, short of the 180,000 that was forecasted. The U.S. Federal Reserve has been dropping hints that an easing monetary action might be needed and that it is ready to act. An interest rate cut has been rising in probability as Fed member remarks and mixed data has been pouring in. Wednesday’s ADP private payrolls data was a preview of how challenging it was for job seekers in May with a 27,000 gain on estimates close to 200,000. Euro Rises After US Jobs Report Shows Employment is Losing Momentum The EUR/USD rose 0.56 percent on Friday and 1.48 percent in the last five trading days after the greenback was on the back foot since the start of the week. Ironically this week the European Central Bank (ECB) issued a dovish statement, but in comparison to market expectations it was not as dovish giving the edge to the euro. Trade disputes continue to guide the market and this week there was progress made, but not enough to delay the tariffs on Mexican imports to the US. Opening two fronts caused the dollar to lose its appeal as a safe haven, and investors decamped to other assets to hedge their dollar positions. The miss by the US jobs report could force the hand of the Fed into making an interest rate cut. A summer cut could be on the table, unless US inflation and retail sales can turn the tide set in motion by the weak May jobs report. Gold Hits 14 Month High as Dollar Drops on Potential Rate Cut Gold rose 0.22 percent on Friday on its way to a 2.64 percent gain in that past five trading days. The yellow metal took advantage of the NFP miss that showed the US employment component is running out of momentum which could force the central bank into its first rate cut since abandoning its monetary easing policy. Gold benefited from the Trump administration’s decision to engage in two open trade fronts at the same time. US-China negotiations stalled, and the market is not expecting anything new before the G20 meeting in Japan at the end of the month. The US escalated its immigration demands with Mexico via a tariff threat that is still very much on, despite both sides issuing positive comments on the negotiations. The yellow metal has risen as investors are searching for a safe haven as the dollar is offering little refuge as market uncertainty has been triggered by the US. Further appreciating gold is the fact that disappointing economic data is making a stronger case for an interest rate cut coming sooner rather than later form the Fed. A soft dollar would continue to validate higher gold prices if trade war anxiety remains. Oil Higher After Russia and Saudi Arabia Hint at OPEC+ Deal Extension Oil prices jumped on a soft dollar and news that a Saudi Arabia and Russia pledge to extend the OPEC+ production cut agreement. The group’s attempt to soak up the excess supply in the market in effort to add stability has for the most part worked. Outside factors such as the rise of US production and trade war concerns putting pressure on global growth have been the major obstacles. Brent and WTI rose close to 3 percent on Friday and will finish the trading week with gains despite trade war anxiety. The World Bank announced a downgrade of global growth as trade disputes are trickling down. Slowdowns in major economies are evident and if protectionism prevails there will be a slower pace of growth around the globe. The upside for the OPEC+ is limited as reducing supply is only one part of the equation and with stable prices the appeal of increasing production in the US, Brazil and Canada will be higher as well as the continued negative effect on energy prices that trade disputes can bring. The month of June is crucial for crude prices as the OPEC+ meets at the end of June with the G20 in Japan a couple of days after. An extension of the production cut, and more details on how the US-China are hoping to repair their trade relationship could make a huge difference for crude prices. Vice versa not reaching an extension on the OPEC+ agreement and if the US and China continue to spar on trade will only bring more downward pressure to the black stuff.

5e5d08d3bd5d9d5ac07275de	Bullish Gold Price Behavior to Persist as Coronavirus Spreads	The price of gold bounces back from the weekly low ($1625) as COVID-19 shows no signs of slowing down, and fears surrounding the coronavirus may keep the precious metal afloat as the outbreak dampens the outlook for global growth. Gold has marked the longest winning streak since June, with the price for bullion trading at its highest level since 2013, and the precious metal may continue to exhibit a bullish behavior as market participants look for an alternative to fiat currencies. The weakening outlook for global growth is likely to put pressure on major central banks to provide monetary support, and the low interest rate environment may heighten the appeal of gold as authorities like the European Central Bank (ECB) rely on non-standard measures to support Euro area. It remains to be seen if the ECB will venture into uncharted territory as the Governing Councilremains reluctant to push the main refinance rate, the benchmark for borrowing costs, into negative territory, but the central bank appears to be on track to expands its balance sheet throughout 2020 as President Christine Lagarde and Co. “stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner.” However, the reliance on unconventional tools may ultimately lead to unintended consequences as the ballooning balance sheet raises the risk for monetary financing, and the price of gold may continue to benefit from the low interest environment as market participants look for an alternative to fiat-currencies. With that said the broader outlook for bullion remains constructive as the reaction to the former-resistance zone around $1447 (38.2% expansion) to $1457 (100% expansion) helped to rule out the threat of a Head-and-Shoulders formation.

5e6f2cc0387889242b4e465f	Welcome To The High Volatility World	The dollar soared last week as a collapse of equity markets and disruption even to sovereign bond markets unveiled a large shortage of dollars. This shortage was seen in the spread of onshore and offshore dollar rates and in the cross-currency basis swaps. The strain seems less evident in the use of the swap lines that the Federal Reserve has in place with several major central banks. The usage was an inconsequential $58 mln, The shortage of funding was also not obvious in the response to the Fed's repo operations. Banks took less than $125 bln of $1.5 trillion in term repos that were offered in the past two sessions. Volatility, which we were previously told was depressed by large central bank balance sheets, has exploded. The increase in ECB's balance sheet and the buying of bonds by the Fed (instead of only bills) did not prevent the equity market meltdown on March 12 or the DAX unwinding nearly 9% gains plus some, on March 13 before settling up around 0.75%. Currency volatility remains elevated. Three-month euro vol rose to three-year highs near 9.5%. A week ago, it was closer to 7.5%. Implied yen vol peaked near 20% its highest level since 2009 before pulling back as the dollar rebounded and closed the week near 13.5 up from a little more than 10% at the end of last week. Sterling, which collapsed to five-month lows last week, saw volatility jump to five-month highs (10.7% vs.7.6%) a week ago. Higher volatility may offer opportunities for investors (e.g., the sale of covered calls) and for some kinds of corporate exposures. Dollar Index: After starting last week by selling off to levels not seen since September 2018 (~94.65), the Dollar Index surged back to around 98.80 before the weekend. It will take a four-day rally into next week and has moved within striking distance of the three-year high reached in late February near 99.90. It posted a weekly key reversal trading on both sides of the previous week's range and closed above its high. The momentum indicators have just crossed higher. The higher volatility requires given stops wider berth. Initial support is seen near 97.20. Euro: The euro nearly reached $1.15 in early Asia to start the week and spent the rest of the week selling off. It reached $1.1050 in the second half of the week, which corresponds to the 20-day moving average and the (61.8%) retracement of the rally from the February 20 low below $1.0800. It settled a little above $1.1105. The price action has led the technical indicators, which have only begun to fall. The technical condition is poor, and follow-through selling could see a retest on the $1.08 area. Resistance is seen near $1.1150, while a move above $1.12 would improve the technical tone. Japanese Yen: The more than the seven-yen range of the dollar last week (~JPY101.20-JPY108.50) was larger than the USD/JPY ranges seen in each of the past three quarters. The 2.85% rally before the weekend was the largest single-day advance in nearly seven years. The shortage of dollars may be most acute for non-bank financial institutions, but it is difficult to know for sure now. The rebound through JPY108 met the (61.8%) retracement objective of the precipitous drop February 22 test on JPY112.20 to last week's low. The 200-day moving average is near JPY108.25, and the March high is around JPY108.60. The technical indicators have turned up from over-extended territory, has the greenback snapped back after tumbling about 5.65% in the previous two weeks. Technically, there is little to stand in the way of a test on the JPY110.00 area. Given the wide swings, it is understandable why the closest support may be in the distance (~JPY105.70-JPY106.00). British Pound: Not to put too fine a point on it, but sterling fell out of bed last week. The 5.9% drop was bigger than the week of June 2016 referendum (~-4.7%) and the flash crash that October (~-4.1%). It was the biggest since the 6.3% drop in a week in January 2009 during the heart of the financial crisis. It began the week by extending its advancing streak for the fifth consecutive session, during which time it gained about 2.8% against the dollar. In the proceeding four sessions, it collapsed by roughly 6.4%. The MACD had not advanced with sterling previously and has turned lower from over-extended condition to begin with. The Slow Stochastic has turned down from the middle of its range. Sterling posted a big outside down week. Nearby support is near $1.22, and a violation could open the door to $1.20. Below there is the flash crash low for which there is some dispute over. Bloomberg has it near $1.1840, and some other platforms put it closer to $1.1770, for example. Sterling's sharp losses against the euro suggest a UK-specific story on top of the broader dollar rebound. The euro surged 4.4% again sterling, its fourth consecutive weekly gain. The almost 9% rally over this streak saw the euro retrace (more than 61.8%) of the sell-off from last August's high (~GBP0.9375) to last December low that was retested last month (~GBP0.8275). Canadian Dollar: After seeming to lag behind the other major central banks, the Bank of Canada has turned more aggressive, delivering a 50 bp emergency rate cut ahead of the weekend after cutting rates the same amount at the policymaking meeting on March 4. The Canadian dollar's recovery after the rate cut coincided with a strong recovery in equities and a bounce in oil prices. The U.S. dollar reversed lower after testing the CAD1.40 level, a four-year high and resistance area we had noted. The measuring objective of the flag or pennant formation is in the CAD1.4100-CAD1.4150 area. After closing the first four sessions of last week above the upper Bollinger® Band, the U.S. dollar closed back under it (~CAD1.3865) on Friday. The technical indicators look poised to turn down. The first downside target is near CAD1.3575 and then CAD1.3655. Australian Dollar: The Australian dollar fell in every session less week that culminated in a 6.5% drop that is the largest since the panic in October 2008. Yet even with the surge in volatility (e.g., three-month vol reached about 18.5% last week, settling near 16.6%, its highest level since 2011. It had been below 6% at the end of last year), the Australian dollar finished the week below its lower Bollinger Band (~$0.6305). The Aussie reached almost $0.6125 ahead of the weekend before recovering to nearly $0.6250 in the late bounce, alongside equities to settle a little above $0.6200. Still, an outside down week was recorded. During the Great Financial Crisis, it bottomed near $0.6000, but according to the OECD's purchasing power parity model, the Aussie is even cheaper now (~9.5% undervalued). The MACD is still trending lower in over-extended territory, while the Slow Stochastic turned down from the middle of its range. Mexican Peso: The U.S. dollar slipped ahead of the weekend against the Mexican peso. It snapped an eight-session advance. It was only the third session the dollar fell since February 14. The dollar's roughly 8.3% rally against the peso last week was only bested against the Colombian peso (which lost almost 10%). The dollar reached a record high near MXN22.50. Meaningful technical resistance doesn't exist. Initial support is seen near MXN21.35, which also corresponds to the five-day moving average. The dollar has not closed below this short-term moving average for nearly two weeks. The MACD has accelerated higher, while the Slow Stochastic is moving sideways. It suggests intraday players are shorting the peso, perhaps as a proxy for risk, and repurchasing it before the end of the session. Chinese Yuan: All of the emerging market currencies fell against the dollar last week. The yuan's 1.1% decline makes it the sixth-best. The yuan fell in the first four sessions before edging up by 0.3% before the weekend. The nearly 1% decline on March 12 was the largest since the first day Chinese re-opened from the extended Lunar New Year holiday (February 3). The dollar held below CNY7.05, which has been the upper end of the range since early February. The momentum indicators of the offshore yuan (CNH) point higher for the dollar. The yuan's volatility is relatively low (three-month implied is about 4.75% vs. 4.35% at the end of 2019). That, coupled with an attractive 10-year yield, around 2.65% offers some attractions for global investors. Consider too that month-to-date the Shanghai Composite is up 0.25%, while most other bourses are down double digits. Gold: As equities collapsed and volatility jumped, and financial stress soared, the price of gold fell by 8.6% last week, which appears to be the largest fall in at least 30 years. Gold's liquidity and recent strength worked against it as investors appeared to sell their gold to cover losses (margin calls) elsewhere. Gold briefly poked above $1700 on Monday and tested $1500 on Friday, near the 200-day moving average. The Slow Stochastic did not confirm the new high before turning lower, leaving a bearish divergence in its wake. The MACD turned lower. The next area of chart support is around $1450. The 60-day rolling correlation of the percent change in gold and the percent change in the S&P 500 turned positive briefly last week for the first time since December 2018. The $1580-$1600 area offers the first hurdle on the upside. Oil: On two sessions, March 6 and March 9, WTI for May delivery fell by more than a third. The compression of demand was met with warnings of a flood of supply. Saudi oil is being sold to some for near $25 a barrel. The price gapped sharply lower at the start of the week, and as it appears on the weekly charts as well, it has added technical significance. The gap is between the mid-week high of $36.70 and the March 6 low of about $41.30. The MACD is headed down, but it is already well below the low seen in the last oil rout in 2014. The Slow Stochastic bottomed in early March and has been flatlining since. A move through last week's high, which recouped nearly half of the losses from the March 6 high, gives the potential to a little more than $39. The crash that began in 2014 bottomed on the futures continuation contract near $26 in early 2016. U.S. Interest Rates: The U.S. 10-year yield bottomed at the start of the week near 31 bp. The 30-year dipped below 70 bp. These extreme readings, in part, reflected a breakdown in the market. The Federal Reserve responded with liquidity measures and new purchase plans. The 10-year yield snapped back to over 1% ahead of the weekend before settling just below. Given that the expectation for overnight rates reflected in the December 2020 Fed funds futures contract has fallen almost 130 bp this year to 11 bp now, the net-net 85 bp decline in the 10-year yield may not be unreasonable. The FOMC meets next week. Nearly everyone expects at least a 75 bp cut. The debate is over the last 25 bp cut. The market sees the Fed bringing the target rate to the zero-bound (0-0.25%) immediately (~66%-75% chance. We understood the decision to buy coupons across the yield curve was a signal that reaching the zero-bound was simply a formality at this juncture. S&P 500: The ghastly week ended on a seemingly positive note that saw the major indices post the biggest percentage gains since October 2008. The lifted the benchmark to 2911 that filled the gap left from March 12. Such dramatic bounces in bear markets are not unprecedented, and the key reversal on March 10 proved for naught, producing more technical scar tissue. The (61.8%) of the rally that advance that began in Q1 16 is found near 2415 and maybe the next important technical target. Still, we sense that there is money on the sidelines looking to buy on a six-month view. The VIX jumped to 77.5% last week, its highest since 2008 (~90%). There is a rule of thumb among technicians who think gaps are important signals that one should fade the third gap. It worked in February and was good for more than a 9% bounce. The third gap low was on March 12. On the upside, the next important chart points may be near 2800 and then 2885.	USD

Up from there, Amazon ended wave ((i)) at 2050 high and the pullback in wave ((ii)) ended at 2033 low. The stock continued to extend higher and broke above previous wave 1 high to create higher high. Currently, wave ((iii)) is still in progress. Near term, while dips stay above April 9 wave 2 low (2017.98), expect Amazon to resume higher for a few more highs to end wave 3. Pullback in wave 4 should follow soon after before it resumes upside.	EQUITY
5e8f9a632e890659ae993bc7	Good Friday Holiday Might Be Quiet But See Extreme FX Volatility	Tomorrow, much of the world is on holiday, celebrating Good Friday. Many stock and bond markets around the world will be closed, such as the U.S., UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Australia, and Canada. Therefore, one may expect that with many market players taking the day off, that the FX markets should be quiet. That has traditionally been a reasonable assumption over a long global holiday weekend. However, in these unprecedented times, any news that may come out tomorrow could also accompany extremely volatility. As participation will be low, there will not be as many resting buy or sell orders in the FX market. There are four events to look for tomorrow which may cause volatility in the fx space: 1. The Data China is due to release their CPI and PPI data tomorrow. Expectations are for 4.8% (YoY) and -1.1% (YoY), respectively. If the data comes out dramatically different than expected, USD/CNH may have a large move. In addition, although the U.S. is closed tomorrow, they are expected to release their own CPI and Core CPI data. Expectations are for -0.3% (MoM) and 0.1% (MoM), respectively. Also, the Federal Reserve’s Mester and Quarles are both expected to speak tomorrow. After today’s Fed moves, any “less dovish” comments could cause the U.S. dollar to spike higher versus any of its counter currencies, on very light volume. 2 .OPEC+ Comments At the time of this writing, OPEC+ have agreed to cut back in production of 10 million bpd through July, then 8 million bpd from July to December, followed by 6 million bpd from January 2021 through April 2022. WTI Crude oil had been going bid into the announcement, however, has sold off from 28.21 to as low as 22.48 after the deal was announced. (May have been “buy the rumor, sell the fact”). However, if the deal does not go through, or if there are negative comments tomorrow, crude could sell off even further. This would cause crude sensitive currencies to move as well, such as USD/CAD, USD/NOK and USD/MNX. 3. European Rescue Plan As of the time of this writing, EU finance ministers have reached an agreement on a European Rescue Plan, (the actual amount has not been provided yet), plus other guaranteed programs. Positive or negative comments regarding this deal could affect Euro pairs. (No mention yet of the words “Coronavirus bonds.”) 4. Coronavirus Updates Although many world markets are closed, the coronavirus does not take the day off. Over the weekends when updates are given, the markets can’t move because they are closed. However, with fx markets open tomorrow, there is the possibility of volatility around the updates. Although tomorrow is a holiday for most of the world, traders must be careful when placing new trades and where to put stop placements. With light market participation, there is the possibility of some violent fx moves if there are any surprises in the market.	EUR
5e5d0926bd5d9d5ac0727658	USD/CAD Extends Top as Crude Oil Prices Rise, Yen May Gain Next	The Canadian Dollar outperformed against its major counterparts on Friday, extending the rally that prolonged throughout the week. Its rise occurred amid a pickup in crude oil prices, a key source of revenue for Canada. That can imply knock-on effects which could translate into monetary policy expectations. Sentiment-linked crude prices were elevated as the markets continued shrugging off concerns about the impact of coronavirus on global growth. This follows China revising the method for counting cases, resulting in a strong surge in reports this past week. A swelling in the Fed’s balance sheet added liquidity into markets. The S&P 500 closed 0.18% to the upside on Friday after reports crossed the wires that the White House is looking into tax incentives for households to purchase stocks. The fate of this, alongside middle-class tax cuts, arguably leans on the outcome of this year’s presidential election. The Euro underperformed, closing at its lowest point against the US Dollar since April 2017. The single currency has been under pressure amid slowing European growth expectations. Preliminary figures showed Eurozone fourth-quarter GDP unexpectedly slowing to 0.9% y/y versus 1.0% anticipated. After market close Friday, the United States Treasury Representative announced that the country will raise levies on European-imported aircraft to 15% from 10%. This follows a green light from the WTO last year that ruled in favor of the United States imposing about $7.5b in tariffs against the European Union. This may translate into a cautiously pessimistic mood as the new week gets rolling. Wall Street is offline Monday for the Presidents’ Day holiday, lowering levels of liquidity. If Asia Pacific equities trade lower, the anti-risk Japanese Yen may gain at the expense of the sentiment-linked Australian Dollar. As expected, USD/CAD turned lower following the emergence of bearish technical signals. Prices took out rising support from late January and have since seen downside follow-through. That places the focus on immediate support at 1.3208.

5e6017075f8dd167d44ad919	Bank of Canada Delivers	Yesterday in our BOC preview, we noted that if the Bank of Canada were to cut rates today it would most likely be on the back of global stimulus due to the coronavirus, and less about the Canadian economy itself. Indeed, the Bank of Canada did cut rates today by 50bps from 1.75% to 1.25% (the lowest level since mid-2018) and noted that it was primarily because the coronavirus would be a negative shock to the economy. The Committee would continue to monitor developments and adjust monetary policy further if necessary. USD/CAD went bid after the announcement, even though price had been moving higher since yesterday in anticipation of a possible rate cut. The headline expectation was for unchanged at 1.75%, however after the US Federal Reserve surprisingly cut rates by 50bps, fx markets began pricing in a BOC cut as well. 50bps was more than markets hoped for and this sent USD/CAD to resistance at the 127.2% Fibonacci extension from the highs from November 20th, 2019 to the lows on December 31st, near 1.3430. Above there, is resistance at Friday’s highs near 1.3465. Horizonal support comes across at 1.3330, and dips to 1.3250 are likely to be bought, as trendline support and horizontal support meet near that level. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com As Canadian rates sit at 1.25%, higher than most of G7 countries (technically, US targets between 1.00%-1.25%), markets may begin to price in another rate cut by the BOC. If such a scenario were to occur, USD/CAD could continue moving higher. On a daily timeframe, it’s easy to see how price has been moving higher off the December 31st lows and pulled back at resistance near 1.3330 to the 200 Day Moving Average as the RSI became overbought, forming a flag formation. On February 21st, price broke out of the flag. The target for a flag the length of the flagpole added to the breakout point of the flag. In this case the target is near 1.3590, just above the horizontal resistance from May 31st, 2019. Of course, nothing moves in a straight line, and a pullback would give the RSI room to unwind as buyers may look to step in and buy the dip.

If the virus continues to plague global growth, including Canada, there may be more ahead from the Bank of Canada.	CAD
5e80608cc970cb48f12f96e6	U.S Dollar Index Speculators Raised Bullish Bets As Euro Bets Surge	Large currency speculators lifted their bullish net positions in the U.S. Dollar Index futures markets this week, according to the latest Commitment of Traders (COT) data released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday. The non-commercial futures contracts of U.S. Dollar Index futures, traded by large speculators and hedge funds, totaled a net position of 12,520 contracts in the data reported through Tuesday, March 24th. This was a weekly rise of 5,368 contracts from the previous week which had a total of 7,152 net contracts. This week’s net position was the result of the gross bullish position (longs) going up by 2,914 contracts (to a weekly total of 22,456 contracts) compared to the gross bearish position (shorts) which saw a decline by -2,454 contracts on the week (to a total of 9,936 contracts). U.S. Dollar Index speculators had cut their bullish bets in the previous three straight weeks and pushed the overall net position to the lowest level in ninety-two weeks at just +7,152 contracts before this week’s turnaround. Despite this week’s gain, the USD Index positions remain under the 2020 weekly average of +16,300 speculator contracts. The dollar index prices cooled as this week went on and ended Friday around the 98.30 level after surging as high as almost 103.00 (late last week and early this week) as traders sought safe haven in the dollar. In the other major currency contracts data, we saw three substantial changes (+ or – 10,000 contracts) in the speculators category this week. Euro speculator bets surged once again this week for a fourth straight week. The euro position has gained by a huge total of +175,311 contracts in just these past four weeks and is now at the most bullish level since June 12th of 2018 (a span of 93 weeks). Canadian dollar bets dropped sharply this week by almost -20,000 contracts and overall, the CAD spec position has declined for four straight weeks. The CAD bets have now been in bearish territory for three straight weeks following thirty-six consecutive weeks in bullish territory. Mexican peso positions fell for an eighth straight week and by a total of -148,387 contracts over that period. The peso position is now down to the least bullish level in sixty-four weeks, dating back to December of 2018. Peso positions had recently hit an all-time high position of +170,366 contracts on January 28th. Overall, the major currencies that saw improving speculator positions this week were the U.S. dollar index (5,368 weekly change in contracts), euro (28,795 contracts), Australian dollar (3,526 contracts) and the New Zealand dollar (4,259 contracts). The currencies whose speculative bets declined this week were the British pound sterling (-7,756 weekly change in contracts), Japanese yen (-9,072 contracts), Swiss franc (-2,483 contracts), Canadian dollar (-19,622 contracts) and the Mexican peso (-11,866 contracts). The above chart depicts each currency’s current speculator strength level compared to data of the past 3 years. A score of 0 percent would mean speculator bets are currently at the lowest level of the past three years. A 100 percent score would be at the highest level while a 50 percent score would mean speculator bets are right in the middle of the data (a neutral score). We use above 80 percent (extreme bullish) and below 20 percent (extreme bearish) as extreme score measurements. Please see the data table and individual currency charts below. This latest COT data is through Tuesday and shows a quick view of how large speculators or non-commercials (for-profit traders) were positioned in the futures markets. All currency positions are in direct relation to the US dollar where, for example, a bet for the euro is a bet that the euro will rise versus the dollar while a bet against the euro will be a bet that the dollar will gain versus the euro. EuroFX: The Euro large speculator standing this week recorded a net position of 61,290 contracts in the data reported through Tuesday. This was a weekly lift of 28,795 contracts from the previous week which had a total of 32,495 net contracts. British Pound Sterling: The large British pound sterling speculator level reached a net position of 10,884 contracts in the data reported this week. This was a weekly lowering of -7,756 contracts from the previous week which had a total of 18,640 net contracts. Japanese Yen: Large Japanese yen speculators totaled a net position of 23,863 contracts in this week’s data. This was a weekly fall of -9,072 contracts from the previous week which had a total of 32,935 net contracts. Swiss Franc: The Swiss franc speculator standing this week resulted in a net position of 4,891 contracts in the data through Tuesday. This was a weekly fall of -2,483 contracts from the previous week which had a total of 7,374 net contracts. Canadian Dollar: Canadian dollar speculators came in at a net position of -29,245 contracts this week. This was a fall of -19,622 contracts from the previous week which had a total of -9,623 net contracts. Australian Dollar: The large speculator positions in Australian dollar futures equaled a net position of -25,207 contracts this week in the data ending Tuesday. This was a weekly lift of 3,526 contracts from the previous week which had a total of -28,733 net contracts. New Zealand Dollar: The New Zealand dollar speculative standing recorded a net position of -16,016 contracts this week in the latest COT data. This was a weekly gain of 4,259 contracts from the previous week which had a total of -20,275 net contracts.

This was a weekly decrease of -11,866 contracts from the previous week which had a total of 33,845 net contracts.	JPY
5e9593ff02bec916b27d8fea	Chinese GDP preview: How first corona contraction data will rock markets, regardless of reliability	"Well before the world knew where Wuhan is on the map, investors suspected statistics from China – especially when it comes to Gross Domestic Product. Nevertheless, the publication early on April 17 will likely be watched closely and impact all markets. Li Keqiang, then the Party Committee Secretary of Liaoning, told the US ambassador that GDP figures in his region were unreliable. That was in 2007 before Keqiang was promoted to Prime Minister. He offered alternative measures for assessing the size of the economy, such as electricity consumption, railway cargo, and other indicators that The Economist later turned it into the Keqiang index. Governors and the state had reasons to report rosier figures than reality suggested. Moreover, Beijing's targets were normally met with incredible precision, also raising eyebrows. China's orchestration of a ""smooth landing"" from quick growth seemed to be smoothed by official statistics. Moreover, China compiles and publishes GDP data less than three weeks after the related quarter concludes and refrains from revisions. Western countries need more time and modify the data as time goes by. COVID-19 also added to doubts. Authorities initially sought to play down the cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, punishing whistleblower doctors before changing its approach. The number of mortalities from the disease is also seen as too low by many, amid anecdotal reports of crematoriums working non-stop in Hubei province, where Wuhan is situated. Having said all that, why should traders await China's first-quarter growth figures? The main reason is the virus. So far, higher frequency data has provided up-to-date – yet partial – data about COVID-19's damage. China will be the first major economy to provide an overview of the impact on the economy. The world's second-largest economy was also the first to suffer from coronavirus and lockdown citizens. Another reason to expect market movement is the impact of the figures on policy in China and in other places. If Beijing publishes upbeat figures, it may provide for other countries – expecting less damage and more demand from China. On the other hand, weak figures may further depress the global economy. The third motive to expect a meaningful reaction is viewing the response to China´s trade balance figures for March. The better-than-expected outcome in both exports and imports improved the market mood on Tuesday, sending stocks higher and the dollar down, with the impact lasting long hours. Commerce figures are less significant than GDP statistics, so traders may expect a substantial move when the data comes out. Economists foresee an outright contraction of 6% in the first quarter of 2020, mirroring the growth rate of 6% seen in the last quarter of 2019. That would be the worst in modern memory. Even in the 2008-2009 crisis, the economy kept expanding. The projected market reaction is straightforward. If Beijing reports slower contraction than expected – a figure closer to 0% – markets would cheer, sending shares higher and the safe-haven dollar and yen lower. The Australian dollar may be one of the biggest beneficiaries as Australia depends on China more than other developed economies. Oil prices could rise on hopes for higher demand, boosting the Canadian dollar. On the other hand, deeper damage to the economy – over 6% contraction – would weigh on equities, boost the safe-haven currencies and drive commodity currencies lower. China's first-quarter GDP figures will be the first broad economic report on the impact of coronavirus on a major economy with a contraction of 6% on the cards. Better figures may boost markets and weigh on the dollar while weaker statistics could trigger a sell-off and gains for the greenback."	CNH
5e5d7b59ff923d7064ef6581	Dollar dips as coronavirus damage spurs interest rate cut bets	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slipped to a six-week low against a basket of currencies on Monday, as investors bet on the U.S. Federal Reserve easing policy in a bid to counter the negative impact from the spread of the new coronavirus. The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six other major currencies, was 0.53% lower at 97.448. Earlier it slipped to a low of 97.176, its lowest since Jan. 16. Global risk assets, including equities, were hammered hard last week as investors worried about the economic impact of the global spread of the virus. The panic in global markets prompted U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to issue a statement on Friday saying the Fed would “act as appropriate” to support the economy. Investors took his comments as a hint that the Fed will deliver a cut when it meets March 17-18, and as an encouragement to central banks around the world to follow suit. Futures <0#FF:> now imply a 50 basis point cut at the meeting. “The negative for the dollar is that the Fed has more leeway than many rival central banks to shock and awe with policy, steps that could do material damage to the currency’s allure,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions. U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in February as the supply chain disruptions arising from the coronavirus outbreak dragged on output and new orders, surveys of purchasing managers showed on Monday. The damage to global markets due to the spread of the coronavirus has raised hopes of a coordinated policy action from global monetary authorities. But policymakers at the European Central Bank, including its president, Christine Lagarde, have shown reluctance to cut rates from the current minus 0.5%. On Monday, the euro was up 1.13% against the dollar. The yen, which tends to draw investors during times of geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the worlds biggest creditor nation, was up 0.1% against the dollar despite Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda saying the BOJ would take necessary steps to stabilize financial markets. Sterling fell broadly, hitting a new four-and-a-half month low against a strengthening euro as traders took a cautious view at the start of talks between Britain and the European Union on their relationship after Brexit.

5e5d092173d82f5acc8afd0a	EUR/GBP May Be Vulnerable with UK Retail Sales, ECB and BOE on Tap	The British pound is the day’s strongest major currency as traders look ahead to tomorrow’s UK retail sales report, which is expected to print at +0.5% m/m. That report is arguably the last significant macroeconomic release of the week, though looking ahead to next week, traders will be sure to key in on the European Central Bank meeting. In our view, the ECB will likely remain on hold after aggressive easing actions in Q4 2019, but with traders pricing in about a 60% chance of a rate cut from the Bank of England later this month (and near 100% odds of a hike in H1), even a neutral outlook is likely to appear hawkish relative to the ECB’s neighbors on the Northern side of the English Channel. All of the above puts EUR/GBP in the crosshairs over the next couple of weeks. Technically speaking, the pair is testing the top of its bearish channel off the August high near 0.9300. More recently, the pair has formed a sideways range between 0.8460 and 0.8580. When rates tested the confluence of the bearish channel and the top of that range earlier this week, they formed a “dark cloud cover” candlestick pattern, showing a shift from buying to selling pressure and marking a potential top in the pair: Source: TradingView, GAIN Capital Moving forward, a weak UK retail sales report could be a near-term catalyst to take EUR/GBP back toward the bottom of its range near 0.8460, while a break below that area could open the door for another couple hundred pips to the downside as we move through Q1. To shift the bearish medium-term bias, traders would need to see a confirmed break above the 0.8580 resistance level.	GBP
5e81b63dc496d2354de73074	Dollar Lower Ahead of Crucial Week for Brexit and Italian Budget	The US dollar is weaker across the board on Friday. The comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Vice-Chair Richard Clarida on interest rates nearing a neutral rate were dollar negative. Rising optimism about the US-China trade disagreement also depreciated the greenback as investors exited the safe haven of the dollar. Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping will meet in Buenos Aires ahead of the G20 summit with the new comments out of the White House boosting the chances of a positive outcome. Sterling was higher on Friday, but continues to print a 1.12 percent drop as Brexit headlines put downward pressure on the currency. UK Prime Minister Theresa May faces a difficult task as the deal agreed to with the EU was always going to be a tough sell. Resignations in her cabinet have followed as the deal makes its way to parliament with an uncertain fate as too many factions disagree on what now is a final deal with the EU with a fast approaching deadline. Euro rises as Fed Member Comments and US-China Hope Sinks Dollar The EUR/USD rose 0.84 percent on Friday. The single currency is trading at 1.1419 after US President Donald Trump said that the US may not have to impose addition tariffs on China. Trade war concerns eased as the two leaders have done some work ahead of their meeting in Buenos Aires at the end of the month. Fed members Clarida and Kaplan were both dovish as they focused on lower growth. The market took it as a sign the central bank could tap the breaks and slow down its path of gradual rate increases. The probability of a rate hike in December is down to 65.4 percent from 72.3 percent a day earlier. Given the attention Brexit news got, the Italian budget drama got little attention after comments from the EU made it clear it takes the position of the nation as a challenge of the Union’s budget rules. Both sides are digging into their positions with Italy claiming that it needs the extra budget to boost growth. The EU could start the procedure to issue sanctions this Wednesday. Sterling Rebounds on Friday, More Brexit Pain to Come The GBP/USD fell 1.12 percent on a weekly basis, after managing a 0.42 percent recovery on Friday. Resignations at PM May’s cabinet have increased the probabilities of a no-deal Brexit as the UK leadership is questioned at a time when a decision has to be made on the deal at hand. The pound has been sensitive to political statements and before the resignation of Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, it had been mostly positive as both UK and EU leaders said a deal was close. With a deal agreed and the publication of the almost 600 page draft members of the cabinet began to resign criticizing the deal. Resignations have come from both the Remain and Leave camps, making the eventual vote in parliament more difficult to predict. Sterling will be under pressure as the European Union has made it known through various channels that the deal will not be revisited in any major way.

5e5d07b4203be655205b7abd	Yen, Swiss franc fall for 4th day as investors stay risk-tolerant	"The safe-haven yen and Swiss franc struggled for a fourth straight session against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, as investors' tolerance for risk increased, encouraged by the Chinese government's efforts to contain the latest coronavirus and limit the economic fallout. The Japanese currency dropped to a two-week low versus the dollar, while the franc fell to its weakest level in more than a week. Investors also cheered news that China would cut in half the additional tariffs imposed on 1,717 U.S. goods last year, following the signing of a Phase 1 trade deal. ""A lot of the risk-off moves over the last two weeks are being unwound,"" said Simon Harvey, FX market analyst at Monex Europe in London. ""We're seeing credible responses from monetary authorities, in China and it looks like it's soothing market fears of a more entrenched slowdown in the Chinese economy,"" he added. Chinese President Xi Jinping told Saudi Arabia's King Salman by telephone that China has achieved ""positive"" results in its prevention and control efforts in fighting the new coronavirus, the country's official Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday The People's Bank of China (PBOC), for its part, has pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial system this week to cushion the potentially adverse economic impact of the virus. That said, the coronavirus has now claimed 563 lives, with more than 28,000 confirmed infections in China. A Reuters tally also showed that 260 cases have been reported in 31 countries and regions outside mainland China. In midmorning trading, the dollar rose 0.1% against the yen to 109.92, and slid 0.2% versus the franc to 0.9754 The euro, meanwhile, tumbled to a two-month low against the dollar, weighed down by data showing German industrial orders unexpectedly plunged in December. That suggested that the euro zone economy would remain sluggish in the opening months of 2020. Contracts for German goods fell 2.1% in December from November, the biggest drop since February. A Reuters poll had forecast a 0.6% rise. The euro's losses pushed the dollar index up 0.1% to 98.432, which benefited as well from Thursday's solid U.S. economic data. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to a nine-month low last week, falling to 202,000 for the week ended Feb. 1. A separate report showed nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 1.4% annualized rate last quarter. ""The overall narrative for the U.S. economy is that it's still in a very strong position compared to other developed markets,"" said Monex's Harvey. The offshore Chinese yuan, meanwhile, was little changed against the greenback, trading at 6.9770 yuan per dollar, after weakening to 7 per dollar on Monday. Broader market volatility fell to new lows, with one-month implied euro-dollar price swings dropping to a record low of 3.7% this week."	CNH
5e79d25c2808fc003636cd1c	EUR/USD Price: Rally at Risk after Shocking Eurozone PMI Data	A shocking set of preliminary Eurozone PMI data for March shows the economy in the single-block free-falling into recession, leaving the Euro exposed against a range of other currencies. The latest PMI readings suggest that Eurozone quarterly GDP is slumping by around 2%, with the likelihood of a further severe downturn. Commenting on the Eurozone flash PMI data for March, Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: “Business activity across the eurozone collapsed in March to an extent far exceeding that seen even at the height of the global financial crisis…the March PMI is indicative of GDP slumping at a quarterly rate of around 2%, and clearly there’s scope for the downturn to intensify further as even more draconian policies to deal with the virus are potentially implemented in coming months.” Commenting on the German flash PMI data for March, Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit said: “The unprecedented collapse in the PMI underscores how Germany is headed for recession, and a steep one at that. The March data are indicative of GDP falling at a quarterly rate of around 2%, and the escalation of measures to contain the virus outbreak mean we should be braced for the downturn to further intensify in the second quarter.” Commenting on the French flash PMI data for March, Eliot Kerr, Economist at IHS Markit said: “The latest PMI data revealed dismal results for the French private sector, with coronavirus-driven shutdowns leading to widespread economic disruption. “March saw a record rate of declines for services activity, while the manufacturing sector suffered to the greatest extent since the global financial crisis. Taken together, these declines suggest GDP is collapsing at an annualised rate approaching double digits. Weekly Euro Forecast – EUR/USD Outlook Remains Bearish EUR/USD recent pick-up has been driven primarily in the recent sell-off of the US dollar after the Federal Reserve announced unlimited QE in order to stem the economic havoc being fueled by the coronavirus. Later today, the US PMIs will be released (13:45 GMT) and need to be closely watched.If EUR/USD breaks the three recent higher lows, further losses may be likely.

5e61b9e61d31d5461e18e065	Gold gains, on way to biggest weekly gain in 11 years as virus risks mount	Gold prices rose on Friday and were on course for their biggest weekly gain since January 2009 as the global spread of the coronavirus dimmed growth prospects and sent investors scurrying for safe-haven assets. Spot gold was up 0.5% at $1,678.25 per ounce. Earlier, it touched a high of $1,689.65, or 1.2%, its highest since January 2013. Prices are up around 6.3% so far this week. U.S. gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,679.50. “The usual out of risky assets into safe havens” flow is fuelling gold’s rise, driven by concerns about the economic fallout from the virus, said Peter Fertig, an analyst at Quantitative Commodity Research. Earlier on Friday, gold prices reversed course, dipping alongside other commodities like oil, after OPEC reportedly failed to reach a deal. Gold tumbled alongside oil prices, which sank 7% to multi-year lows as OPEC’s allies reportedly rejected additional production cuts proposed by OPEC on Thursday, according to a report from Reuters. There are also reportedly questions over whether the existing production cuts will be extended, Reuters said. The meeting between OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, is underway in Vienna after talks were delayed. Gold is on pace for its biggest weekly gain since January 2009 as the global spread of the coronavirus dimmed growth prospects and sent investors scurrying for safe-haven assets. “The market has no understanding of what’s going on. Investors are buying bonds as well as gold as insurance from the deteriorating economic outlook,” said SP Angel analyst Sergey Raevskiy. Globally, there have been more than 98,000 cases and over 3,300 deaths from the coronavirus. The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday said the outbreak would hold 2020 global output gains to their slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The epidemic poses “evolving risks” to the U.S. economy and central bank officials are monitoring developments closely, New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said on Thursday. “Gold is looking to be one of the most attractive assets to own now as short term interest rates fall to near zero and most equity earnings are also expected to fall,” Phillip Futures analysts said in a note. “However a drastic and prolonged drop in equity prices may not be good for gold as traders cash in from gold to pay off margin calls in equity.” The U.S. Federal Reserve made an emergency 50 basis point interest rate cut on Tuesday. Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. Elsewhere, palladium rose 3.1% to $2,610.80 per ounce. The autocatalyst metal had hit an all-time high of $2,875.50 in late February. Silver was up 0.2% to $17.45 an ounce, while platinum rose 4.1% to $900.08.	METAL

5e7bf58d60ce3d6787c8eebd	Canadian Dollar Rose, USD/CAD Uptrend Held. Virus Bill Vote Delayed?	The Canadian Dollar was one of the best performing majors on Wednesday as sentiment continued to improve amid bets on aggressive US fiscal stimulus. CAD gains picked up pace during the Wall Street session as crude oil prices trimmed losses from earlier in the day. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 closed 1.15% and 2.39% to the upside as the haven-linked US Dollar saw cautious weakness. Emerging market shares also ticked higher. Yet some nervousness is brewing with Wall Street futures pointing lower heading into Thursday’s Asia Pacific trading session. The sentiment-linked Australian Dollar and similarly-behaving New Zealand Dollar are falling as the anti-risk Japanese Yen is rising. The Canadian Dollar is also trimming some of Wednesday’s performance as the US Dollar aims cautiously higher. Towards the end of the North American session, Senators Bernie Sanders, Lindsey Graham, Ben Sasse and Tim Scott expressed various concerns about the $2 trillion stimulus package and threatened to delay a vote on it. This may have been why the S&P 500 and Dow Jones trimmed gains into the close and left foreign exchange markets expressing a “risk-off” tilt. The markets are likely placing an emphasis on expediency for policymakers to pass a fiscal package. Threats to the timing risk worsening the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak in the very near term. Later today, US jobless claims are anticipated to surge at a record pace. With that in mind, there may be scope for the US Dollar to recover ahead as the Greenback follows key rising support from earlier this month. USD/CAD could be facing a very important technical turning point. The pair is testing “outer” support on the 4-hour chart below. This follows a break under “inner” support earlier in the week. The former is maintaining the upward trajectory. A daily close under 1.4145 – 1.4177 risks overturning the dominant uptrend. Otherwise, we may see the Canadian Dollar weaken towards falling resistance from this month’s peak.

5e70f5d65c014a44c4d70a01	Sterling falls to 6-1/2 month lows as investors snap up dollars	LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling dropped to its lowest level against the dollar since early September on Tuesday, as investors hoovered up the U.S. currency and after Britain toughened its approach to containing the coronavirus outbreak. The pound has been in retreat as fears about the likely full economic impact of the pandemic have roiled global markets and sent investors fleeing to assets seen as relative safe havens, including the dollar. Analysts say sterling is also vulnerable given Britain’s high current account deficit. The pound fell as much as 2% to $1.2029 on Tuesday before recovering slightly. The British currency last traded at such levels back in September, at the height of fears the country was headed for a sudden, disorderly exit from the European Union. Against the euro it edged up 0.3% to 90.97 pence per euro, but was still trading near the previous day’s six-month low of 89.89 pence. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday tightened restrictions and placed curbs on social life in Britain. Analysts expect the Bank of England (BoE) to take further action to limit the economic fallout at its next meeting on March 26. “We could potentially see more BoE stimulus coming through soon - for example a 15 basis point rate cut and potentially £100bn+ Gilt buying QE (quantitative easing) scheme,” analysts at ING said in a note. Money markets are pricing in a 33% chance of a further 25 basis point BoE interest rate cut next week.

5e62a8f0daad8d46b8f89fef	A Multi-Year USD Downward Trend Has Probably Begun	In recent days, the foreign exchange market has consistently points to a high level of concerns among investors. However, the stock market has had a short break in the form of a bounce. As it often happens, currency movements act as a more reliable barometer of sentiment, especially during the period of high uncertainty on the stock markets. The stock indices rebound on Wednesday was accompanied only by the suspension of the Swiss franc and yen growth. Due to negative interest rates in the Eurozone, the single currency is also increasingly visible to investors during periods of sell-off of risk assets. USDJPY dropped on Friday morning to 105.8, the low area since September 2018, where it was at the peak of fears of the consequences around trade wars. However, it is essential to pay attention to the dynamics, not to the absolute figures. In two weeks the pair lost 5.7% – the sharpest two-week decline since 2016. The confident dynamics below 105 causes us to consider the levels near 100 as the next stop for the pair. USDCHF shows even wilder fluctuations, falling in the area of 0.9440, where it was two years ago and now shows the most significant drop since the beginning of 2018. It should also be understood that the franc has entered the area of the minimum trading range of the last five years. Further demand for protective assets is quite likely to take the rate to the next level – in the support area of 2014 near 0.8700. The single currency also passed a significant local level at 1.1200. With a sharp movement yesterday, the pair broke the resistance of the descending corridor and fixed above the 200 SMA. Despite the local overbought, such a sharp growth suggests that the euro is beginning a long growth trend against the USD. More precisely, it can be called a tendency for the dollar weakening against major currencies. In the short term, demand for the yen, the franc and the euro, as safe-havens, means that demand for protective assets prevails against the background of liquidation of risk positions. It is a symptom of further market weakening in the coming days. From a longer-term perspective, a weak dollar will sooner or later turn the markets towards growth. In our case, we should say that the situation will worsen first, and only then will correct. If the actions of the U.S. authorities are active enough, it will allow avoiding the bearish market in stocks, keeping the current decline within the correction zone. For the USD, however, such a policy may become a turning point, interrupting its growth in recent years, with the same dynamics as was in 2002-2008, when there was a multi-year weakening of the USD with short breaks.

5e94943b0c0eb06c0bcc8939	Dollar flat in thin trade with Europe on holiday	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was roughly flat on Monday morning in North America, with trading volumes thin due to a holiday in Europe. The dollar index =USD, which measures the greenback against a basket of six rival currencies, was up 0.04%. Against the euro EUR=, the dollar was 0.35% stronger at $1.090. Though the U.S. currency had earlier drifted higher against the Australian and New Zealand dollars, as the weekend's OPEC+ deal failed to soothe demand concerns, those trends had mostly reversed in mid-morning trade. “The U.S. dollar ticked higher in the holiday-light trade. Gains against the euro and commodity currencies provided a general boost to the greenback, which was otherwise weaker against the yen and sterling,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions. Major oil producers agreed to the output cuts on Sunday to prop up oil markets as the pandemic severely curtailed global demand. “Oil-exposed currencies were subdued despite OPEC’s record production cuts of nearly 10 million barrels a day. The cartel hopes that the record agreement will help put a floor under oil prices. Still, the outlook remains troubled for oil markets given that the coronavirus has significantly damaged demand,” said Manimbo. Financial markets remain on edge over the spread of the novel coronavirus as severe restrictions on personal movement drag the global economy into a deep recession. However, a slower flow of news in the past few days has boosted risk assets modestly, and the dollar, which serves as a safe-haven asset, has drifted modestly lower. The greenback has also been pressured in the last few weeks by Federal Reserve measures that have flooded the financial system with dollars to address a liquidity crunch caused in part by demand for the U.S. currency. “The backdrop over the past week has been “no news is good news,” which has boosted risk assets,” said Mark McCormick, global head of foreign exchange strategy at TD Securities. “We don’t expect this dynamic to last much longer,” said McCormick. “As we leave the acute phase of the crisis, the market will have to deal with the underlying data and the uncertainty of the CV-19 exit strategies. The latter will be piecemeal and bumpy. It’s a dance of fits and starts rather than a binary event of economy on/off. In turn, we expect another bump in the USD.” Reporting by Kate Duguid; Editing by Steve Orlofsky	USD
5e95587028df1762c643181c	GBP Futures: Extra gains on the cards	CME Group’s advanced data for GBP futures markets noted open interest rose for the second session in a row on Monday, this time by nearly 1.2K contracts. Volume, on the other hand, extended the erratic performance once again and shrunk by nearly 29.3K contracts. Cable is prolonging the upside momentum amidst rising open interest, which should pave the way for further gains in the short-term horizon. That said, following the recent breakout of the 1.2500 barrier, the target is now at the 200-day SMA in the mid-1.2600s.	GBP
5e8b37ac96223b7ce029341e	Congress should send everyone a $1,200 check every month	The global economy is in the grips of an economic crisis of unknown depth and duration. The coronavirus has laid bare the unintended consequences of globalization — the vulnerability of just-in-time global supply chains lacking suitable redundancies and the pauperacy of conventional monetary and fiscal policies. As COVID-19 extended the New Year holiday for Chinese manufacturing and the virus spread to the industrialized north of Italy, production was selectively disrupted by shortages of components made by only one supplier or in one region. As the virus spread to America and businesses dialed down or shut altogether, investors panicked and stocks slid into bear-market territory, because they could not gauge the arch of the pandemic, how effectively the president, governors and leaders elsewhere could address it, and how long the economy would operate at reduced speed. Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts could do nothing to ensure imports from China and other places resumed or halt the spread of COVID-19 in America. With many restaurants, schools, factories and retailers closed and heathy folks working from home and not traveling, what began as a supply-side crisis — a shortage of parts and components from China, Italy and other sources — morphed into a Keynesian recession — consumers are not spending. Not necessarily because they don’t want to spend but often because they can’t. While some businesses are experiencing surges — medical supply manufacturers and Walmart WMT, -3.23% from panic buying for household supplies — many more are laying off workers. Unite Here represents 300,000 employees in hospitality, restaurants, airports and other industries. It estimates 80% to 90% of those will be laid off. State unemployment offices have seen overwhelming surges in new claims. Businesses facing declining sales and losses became desperate to fortify cash balances and ran down lines of credit. They sold Treasuries and other securities usually held for liquidity. That cratered stocks SPX, -0.16%, bond TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.715% and commodity markets CL00, -6.97% — and pressured lending limits of banks and threatened money-market funds, which also provide short-term credit to businesses. The Fed and Treasury moved quickly to shore up banks and money-market funds, and support markets for state and municipal bonds and consumer credit. And the Fed rolled out new tools to create facilities that will offer loans directly to corporations and small businesses with new capital supplied by Treasury. Fed and Treasury credits cannot replace lost sales to business, and whatever loans they extend will add to debt burdens in thin-margin industries. Massive fiscal stimulus is needed to save the real economy. With the arch of the pandemic uncertain, economists are challenged to estimate the impact on the economy. Morgan Stanley expects unemployment to jump to 13% in the second quarter and the St. Louis Federal Reserve estimates 30%. Coupled with lost productivity from reduced hours and awkward work at home situations, a jump in unemployment to 20% by this summer could cost $4 trillion to $5 trillion. Seen in this context, the recently passed $2 trillion stimulus package — including direct payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment benefits, and assistance to small businesses and heavily impacted industries like airlines — may prove hardly enough. If the virus does not peak by May, the economic contraction will deepen to levels not seen since the Great Depression. Loans that become grants if businesses maintain employment near pre-crisis levels are helpful but as the virus subsides and stores reopen, consumer habits will have changed. And it is impossible to target aid in the amounts needed and to those who need it in sufficient amounts to avert bankruptcies and millions of permanently lost jobs. Treasury foresees mailing out checks to individuals starting late in April. That will challenge the IRS and be much delayed, because Congress is scaling payments according to family incomes and size. Much of the aid to businesses is subject to time-consuming, uncertain and unrealistic conditions to maintain employment and cap salaries. Expanded unemployment benefits, though attractive on equity grounds, will be paid out over several months but will not give the economy the large, quick jolt that loading all the aid to individuals into quicker direct payments could provide. Congress should consider another round of stimulus — checks for $1,200 to virtually every American every month through September. Otherwise, another Great Depression is in the offing because of the lack of a large enough immediate action. U.S stocks finished lower Tuesday, a sharp U-turn from the morning’s highs, despite growing signs that the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic may be leveling off in parts of the world.

5e5df6ac0987a13c20d5f5d2	Dollar sinks after US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates to battle coronavirus	The U.S. dollar fell across the board after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Tuesday in an emergency move designed to shield the world’s largest economy from the impact of the coronavirus. In a statement, the central bank said it was cutting rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%. “The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity. In light of these risks and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals, the Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate,” the Fed said a statement. The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six other major currencies, was 0.14 % lower, after falling 0.555% to 96.991 earlier in the session. The index slipped to fresh 6-week low of 96.926 after the interest rate decision before paring losses. “This is definitely not good for the dollar,” said Mark McCormick, global head of FX strategy at TD Securities. While the U.S. has room to cut interest rates, other developed economies have already slashed rates to record lows and may be hesitant to reduce them further. That is likely to weigh on the U.S. currency and boost the currencies of other countries, he said. The Fed’s move comes shortly after Group of Seven finance officials said on Tuesday they would use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable global growth and safeguard against downside risks posed by the fast-spreading coronavirus. Global risk assets, including equities, were hammered hard last week as investors worried about the economic impact of the global spread of the virus. The safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc gained on the dollar on Tuesday, as investors remained nervous about the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak. The yen, which tends to attract investors during times of geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the world’s biggest creditor nation, was up about 1% against the dollar, while the Swiss franc, another safe haven, rose 0.7%. The euro, lifted in recent sessions by hopes that the U.S. would be able to do more on rate cuts than the Europe, was up 0.57% against the dollar. On Tuesday, the Australian dollar was 1.28% higher after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut interest rates by 25 basis points, as anticipated. Markets had priced the possibility of a larger cut. Sterling rose 0.54% against the dollar on Tuesday, even as Britain’s fractious trade talks with the EU and expectations of rate cuts to counter coronavirus damage kept the currency near recent 4-1/2-month lows.

5e8b563496606314e9ceefa4	USD/MXN And Other EM Currencies May Be Topping	Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has been slow to pull the trigger on a large stimulus plan as many other countries have done. However, on Sunday he established a public works program to help the poor and to create jobs. In addition, he created a program to provide low interest rates loans to boost small businesses and housing. Emerging market currencies, in general, have been getting hit over the last few weeks. However, after putting in all-time highs on March 24, USD/MXN appears as though it may be ready for a pullback. Although there is still half the day left in U.S. trading, the pair appears to be putting it a shooting star candlestick formation, after spiking through the all-time highs to 25.78 in the Asian session. This is an indication of a possible reversal as bears overtake the bulls (on a possible short squeeze above the highs) and push price lower, closer to the open. In addition, the RSI is diverging from price as it is nowhere near a new high, as price had done. On a 240-minute USD/MXN has put in a bearish engulfing candlestick formation at the highs, which is also considered a reversal formation. The pair is close to support near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level from the low on March 26 to today's highs near 24.6590. There is also horizontal support near this level. If price breaks lower from here, the next support would be the 50% retracement level and trendline support near 24.3152. Below here is the 61.8% retracement level from the same time frame at 23.9700 and final horizontal support at a full retracement of the recent move, at 22.85. Resistance is at today’s highs near 25.77. Is this move in USD/MXN solely related to the fiscal moves by Obrador? Probably not. The reversal nature appears to be common today across other emerging market pairs as well. After the USD/ZAR put in all-time new highs today at 19.34, the pair is reversing and has pulled back into the body of Friday's candle and is currently down 1.6% today. And USD/BRL is currently putting in a bearish engulfing candlestick formation today, down 2.15% near 5.2350 after putting in an all-time high at 5.3529 on Friday. The RSI is also diverging with price. Although Mexico has finally put in measures over the weekend to help the Mexican economy, today’s move in USD/MXN may not be solely because of that. Other Emerging Market currencies are also taking a breather versus the U.S. dollar as pairs need to unwind a bit after a strong move higher.	MXN
5e7e1b136bd8674daabc8b1b	Crude Oil Price Drives Lower with S&P 500, VIX Snaps Back	Markets look like a sea of red so far during Friday’s trading session. Risk assets like crude oil and the S&P 500 Index appear to be resuming their broader downtrends after experiencing a short-lived relief bounce earlier in the week. The ‘bear market bounce’ in oil and stocks likely came on the back of a recovery in investor sentiment driven by massive amounts of liquidity from the FOMC and an unparalleled $2 trillion fiscal stimulus bill to offset economic pain inflicted by coronavirus pandemic. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView As dismal economic data starts to trickle in, however, such as the historical plunge in Markit PMI, the sharpest drop in consumer sentiment since October 2008 or the record-smashing spike in jobless claims, markets may remain in risk-aversion mode considering a recession likely looms. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView Meanwhile, measures of volatility like the VIX ‘fear-gauge’ and oil volatility (OVX) or high yield corporate bond volatility (VXHYG) are starting to climb back higher toward extreme readings not witnessed since market panic during the global financial crisis. With the VIX Index and other volatility benchmarks on the rise, there could be more pain ahead for the S&P 500 and oil while safe-haven assets come back into demand. -- Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight	USD
5e8bd49f6920b90fccdfb2d0	Pound stays on back foot as Johnson enters intensive care	TOKYO (Reuters) - The pound edged lower against the dollar and the euro on Tuesday after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved to intensive care after his coronavirus symptoms worsened. The dollar held onto gains against the euro, the yen, and the Swiss franc as tentative signs that deaths due to the novel coronavirus in hot spots in the United States and Europe were starting to slow supported risk sentiment. The yen was steady against major currencies after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe unveiled fiscal stimulus worth almost $1 trillion and agreed to declare a state of emergency for Tokyo and other parts of Japan to slow coronavirus infections. Many investors are looking for signs of a peak in the coronavirus pandemic, but some analysts warn of volatility given the unpredictable nature of the previously unknown virus. “The currency market has remained fairly calm, but there will be more downside for sterling if Johnson’s condition worsens,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. “The yen will not react much to the state of the emergency, because other currencies are focused on signs that the coronavirus curve is starting to flatten out.” The pound GBP=D3 traded at $1.2234 on Tuesday in Asia following a 0.3% decline on Monday. Against the euro, sterling EURGBP=D3 slipped by 0.19% to 88.39 pence. Johnson was admitted to hospital on Sunday night and had been undergoing tests after suffering persistent coronavirus symptoms, including a high temperature, for more than 10 days. Downing Street had said he was still conscious, though his condition deteriorated in the early evening. Britain has no formal succession plan should the prime minister become incapacitated, but Johnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputise for him. The dollar traded at $1.0798 per euro EUR=EBS, holding onto six sessions of gains. Against the save-haven Swiss franc CHF=EBS, the greenback traded near a two-week high of 0.9796. Risk sentiment improved after the governors of New York and New Jersey pointed to tentative signs that the coronavirus outbreak in their states was starting to plateau. The Australian dollar AUD=D3 edged up 0.5% against its U.S. counterpart, while the New Zealand dollar rose 0.35% against the greenback as investors felt more comfortable buying currencies sensitive to risk. The dollar fell 0.22% to 108.99 yen JPY=EBS on Tuesday ahead of Japan's declaration of a state of emergency. On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to roll out an unprecedented economic stimulus, equal to 20% of economic output, as his government vowed to take “all steps” to battle the deepening fallout from the coronavirus.

5e79513fadedf833dcb7cbf9	Canadian Dollar Sinks as Crude Oil Prices Swing, USD May Weaken	The Canadian Dollar fell on Monday, responding negatively to intraday swings in sentiment-linked crude oil prices. CAD appeared to pay more attention to declines than gains in WTI as the Dow Jones and S&P 500 closed -3.04% and -2.93% to the downside in another volatile day on Wall Street. Investors weighed the implications of more aggressive Fed stimulus versus Congress being unable to pass a fiscal package. Markets initially welcomed the Federal Reserve announcing unlimited quantitative easing. The central bank said that it will purchase bonds and mortgage-backed securities “in the amounts needed” to support a smooth functioning market. This is on top of already slashing rates to a 0.00 – 0.25% range and relaunching 2008 crisis-era tools to help boost liquidity in financial markets. There is also much urgency in passing a fiscal package to accompany monetary policy given the limits of the latter prior to the coronavirus outbreak. A US$2 trillion relief bill was unable to gather enough votes in the Senate on Monday as lawmakers struggled to agree on the details of the measure. A delay in its passage may have been what erased gains that equities were able to pull off earlier in the Wall Street session. The US Dollar had a mixed session, outperforming against the Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen and British Pound. This is as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered the country’s citizens to stay home “except for essential reasons”. The Greenback continued to gain on some of its emerging market and ASEAN counterparts. Capital flight continues to pose a risk for markets in developing economies as the USD gains. A lack of key economic event risk places the focus for foreign exchange markets on sentiment during Tuesday’s Asia Pacific trading session. Futures tracking Wall Street are pointing cautiously higher, pointing to what may be a “risk-on” tilt to come. The haven-linked US Dollar is weakening with the growth-linked Australian Dollar attempting to progress higher. US President Donald Trump mentioned that both Democrats and Republicans are “fairly close” on a stimulus bill. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi is preparing a $2.5 trillion package. Signs of a further delay in passing a virus relief bill risks souring market mood. Otherwise the Greenback could see some weakness in the near term as AUD/USD and NZD/USD rise. USD/CAD could thus fall. The situation is highly fluid however. USD/CAD continues to trade sideways under highs from 2016 which make for a key range of resistance between 1.4576 to 1.4690. Yet the dominant uptrend is being supported by two levels of rising support, “inner” and “outer” on the 4-hour chart below. Taking out the former may fuel a further correction, but it may not necessarily overturn the upward trajectory.

5e754b18705a03371315ddeb	VIX Peels Back as S&P 500 Stabilizes; High Volatility Still a Threat	The stock market selloff since mid-February has pushed the S&P 500 Index 30% lower from its all-time record high just below the 3,400 level. Despite aggressive action from the Federal Reserve and Trump administration to stimulate the economy, which are aimed at offsetting the economic cost of the coronavirus pandemic, bearish sentiment continues to steer stocks lower. In fact, the stock market rout recorded over the last five trading sessions caused the S&P 500 Index to drop by 15% for its biggest weekly decline since October 2008 amid the global financial crisis. As global central banks and governments announce efforts to counter the novel coronavirus outbreak, however, the slide in stocks could start to decelerate. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView Following the parabolic rise in the VIX Index to crisis-level highs over the last three weeks, the popular fear-gauge has started to pull back from near record readings. A higher VIX reading tends to indicate a higher degree of uncertainty and risk surrounding the direction of the S&P 500 Index over the next 30-days. As such, there is generally a strong inverse correlation between the S&P 500 and VIX Index. Although, the retracement lower in the VIX Index might be explained partly by the technical impact of quadruple witching volatility as traders roll their expiring options and futures contracts. Also, other cross-asset volatility benchmarks suggest more pain could be ahead for stocks and other risk assets. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView As recession risk intensifies amid the worsening coronavirus pandemic and a confounding plunge in crude oil prices, the latest surge in cross-asset volatility is likely here to stay. Two volatility benchmarksreflecting 30-day implied volatility for crude oil and high yield corporate bonds, OVX and VXHYG, still linger around their highest readings on record while FX volatility climbs. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView The recent crash in crude oil and rekindled recession risk, which is likely fueling the rise in default risk faced by a significant portion of high-yield corporate bonds and CLO market, has caused VXHYG to slingshot to its highest reading on record. At the same time, the iShares High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (Ticker Symbol: HYG) crumbled at its fastest rate since – you guessed it – October 2008. That said, VXHYG might stay elevated as credit markets remain under serious strain and could keep the VIX Index relatively anchored to these financial crisis-high levels of volatility. Correspondingly, the direction of high-yield corporate bonds, VXHYG and the VIX have potential to serve as bellwether to where the S&P 500 Index heads next.

5e845d519711880b60f822e4	Sterling slips as dollar surges on global recession angst	"LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling slipped on Wednesday, losing ground to a surging dollar amid a wider selloff in global stock markets as data showed factory activity across the world contracting sharply due to the coronavirus pandemic. Manufacturing gauges tumbled across the globe, with Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) surveys in Asia, the euro zone and the UK underscoring the widening damage wrought by the pandemic that has infected more than 700,000 people, upended supply chains and led to city lockdowns worldwide. Data showed output from Britain’s manufacturing sector shrank at the fastest pace since the euro zone debt crisis in March as the spread of coronavirus led to a spiralling of delays and hammered business confidence. The final version of the IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slumped to 47.8 -- its lowest since July 2012 -- from 51.7 in February, slightly weaker than a preliminary ""flash"" reading of 48.0 recorded earlier in March. (Graphic: UK manufacturing PMI png, here) For an interactive version of the below chart, click here reut.rs/2yqrEkH. Transport delays and raw materials shortages led to the steepest increase in vendor lead times in the PMI’s 28-year history and business optimism slumped to the lowest level on record. Job losses were the most severe since July 2009. By 0853 GMT, the pound was half a percent lower to the dollar at $1.2353. It was 0.2% higher to a broadly weaker euro at 88.62 pence. Sterling’s movements over the last few weeks have largely been dollar driven, with recent gains against the greenback due to an easing of demand for the U.S. currency as central banks pump billions of dollars of liquidity into markets. “The ebbs and flows we’ve seen in the pound in recent weeks have been due to the broader liquidation of global portfolios and the scramble for U.S. dollar funds,” said Viraj Patel, FX and global macro strategist at Arkera. Patel noted that while central bank liquidity provisions have served as a temporary backstop to this theme, the scramble for dollars will likely continue. “The bleak economic reality becoming clear in the data - as well as a prolonged shutdown in economies - will likely trigger another wave of global asset selling and corporate defaults.” Ratings agency Fitch cut Britain’s sovereign debt rating last week, saying the country’s debt would surge as the government ramped up spending to offset the near shutdown of the economy in the face of the virus. Other signs Britain’s economy was taking a hit from the virus were starting to show: prices on the British high street fell at their fastest pace in nearly two years in early March, the British Retail Consortium trade body and market research firm Nielsen said.

5e5d08052e1fe5553d2b63d2	Economic Data Puts the EUR and the Loonie in the Spotlight	It was a relatively busy day on the economic calendar through the Asian session this morning. Key stats included home loan figures out of Australia and trade data out of China On the monetary policy front, the RBA also released its monetary policy statement. On the geopolitical risk front, positive updates from Beijing and Washington on trade failed to support risk appetite early on. According to the ABS, home loans rose by 1.4% in September, month-on-month, and following on from a 1.8% rise in August. Economists had forecast a 1.3% increase. On the monetary policy front, salient points from the RBA monetary policy statement included: The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.69010 to $0.68913 upon release of the figures and the RBA monetary policy statement. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was down by 0.22% to $0.6883. The USD trade surplus widened from $39.65bn to $42.81bn in October. Exports fell by just 0.9%, which was better than a forecasted fall of 3.9%. Imports fell by 6.4%, coming in ahead of a forecasted 8.9% fall. At the time of writing, the Japanese Yen was up by 0.05% to ¥109.22 against the U.S Dollar, while the Kiwi Dollar was down by 0.02% to $0.6365. It’s a relatively quiet day ahead on the economic calendar. September trade data is due out of Germany that will provide direction later this morning. Of less influence on the day, barring dire numbers, are 3rd quarter non-farm payroll figures out of France. At the time of writing, the EUR was up by 0.02% to $1.1052. It’s a quiet day ahead on the data front. There are no material stats due out of the UK to provide the Pound with direction. A lack of stats will leave the markets to further respond to Thursday’s BoE policy decision and forward guidance. On the geopolitical risk front, UK politics will continue to grip the Pound. At the time of writing, the Pound was down by 0.02% to $1.2815. It’s another quiet day ahead on the economic calendar. Prelim Michigan consumer expectations and sentiment figures are due out for November. With forecasts Dollar positive, any soft numbers would likely test the Dollar late in the day. Outside of the numbers, geopolitics will continue to be an influence on the day, with trade talks in focus. The Dollar Spot Index was down by 0.03% to 98.112 at the time of writing. It’s a busy day on the economic calendar. Key stats due out of Canada include October employment change figures and unemployment rate. September housing start and building permit figures will likely have a muted impact on the Loonie. With the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 5.5%, the focus will likely be on the employment change numbers. Outside of the numbers, chatter on trade will also provide direction for crude oil prices and the Loonie later in the day. The Loonie was down by 0.08% to C$1.3184, against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing.	EUR
5e6a90446521bf6ad3d54d5d	When the Bazooka Misses….	The New York Federal Reserve today said it would conduct $500 Billion 3 -month repo operations A DAY for the next 3 days. That is a possible $1.5 Trillion worth of treasury buying. This is not the typical “Not QE” we have been seeing since the Fall. This is the real thing, real QE. But one must consider that with such a HUGE move by the Fed, why did stocks pull back after a 150-handle rally in the S&P 500? Stocks rallied on the news from roughly 2500 to 2650, then traded back down to 2525? Something’s not right. Source: Tradingview, CME, FOREX.com What information can we get from this type of price action? This tells me that there are still a ton of people who are long the market from much higher, and still have not capitulated yet! They are willing to sell any bounce to get out, even if it means a “smaller” loss. One would think that there is still room left for the markets to go on the downside. In extreme selloffs like this, the move doesn’t seem to end until every long is squeezed out of the market! According to CNN’s Fear & Greed Index, the market is now in “Extreme Fear” at 2! The last reading before this article was at 2:22pm ET. The Fed announcement was at 1:00pm, and yet the index is still at 2. This is meant to be a contrarian indicator, just as any overbought or oversold oscillator. However, just as with any oscillator they can stay at extremes, until they don’t. Source: Tradingview, CNN, FOREX.com Take a look at the DXY. Price had been moving higher all day. It seems that the US Dollar is now the “safe haven” currency. However, on a 240-minute chart, the DXY is putting in a large shooting star formation. As the announcement was released by the Fed, the DXY moved lower, as there would be a fresh supply us US Dollars in the market. However, given the range of the day, 223 pips, one may have expected price to fall more than to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement for the day. Mixed signals. There is support just below at 97.19 (the low of the candle), but with such a huge supply of US Dollars by the Fed, one could have expected a much larger retracement! Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com What now? Carry on. There is a large band of support in S&P 500 from the December 2018 lows between 2316.75 and 2475. That may seem like a rather large band for the S&P 500, however not these days. In DXY, with a shallow retracement, watch if price continues the move higher. If so, that will be confirmation that the bazooka missed its target!	USD
5e78b44594363c33d2360737	Dow Jones Rises, USD Drops as Fed Announce Unlimited QE	This morning the Federal Reserve have announced a fresh set of stimulus measures in which they will purchase mortgage backed securities (MBS) and Treasuries in unlimited size (open-ended QE) in order to smooth market functioning. As reminder, the Federal Reserve stated last week that they would purchase a minimum $500bln of treasuries and $200bln of MBS. Alongside this, in order to support the flow credit to employers, consumers and businesses the Federal Reserve will provide as much as $300bln in new financing as the spread of the coronavirus puts the US economy at risk of a sharp recession. Market reaction: Following the announcement by the Federal Reserve, US equities jumped, with the Dow Jones futures trading in positive territory for the session (at the time of writing), while gold broke above $1500, hitting a high of $1523. Across currency markets, the US Dollar dipped by 102 before partially paring the initial move love. That said, this latest announcement adds to a long list of unprecedented measures already taken by the Federal Reserve.

5e832805a8dd8e67f42fed20	There was no stopping the rising U.S. dollar in 3rd quarter	Currency traders apparently aren’t paying much attention to the White House. While President Donald Trump has made clear his frustration with the dollar’s strength relative to other major currencies — to the point that strategists war-gamed the potential impact of unilateral U.S. intervention in the foreign exchange markets — the greenback spent the third quarter in rally mode. Read:Why the U.S. dollar is cementing its role as a global safe haven On Tuesday, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.75%, a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.3% at 99.378 after hitting its highest level since April 2017. That caps a third quarter that’s seen the index rise 3.4%, its strongest quarterly rise since a 5% rally in the second quarter of 2018. That could be a factor as earnings season gets under way. A strong dollar can be a headwind — and a handy excuse for disappointing performance — for exporters, including large-cap multinationals. So it will be interesting to see how much the dollar’s strength factors into management discussions of third-quarter performance. Compared to a year ago, the DXY is up around 4.4%, while the euro EURUSD, -0.98% is nursing a 6.1% year-over-year decline. The dollar has lost ground versus the Japanese yen USDJPY, +0.75%, however, down 6.1% year-over year. When it comes to the dollar index, however, it’s the euro that sets the tone. The euro is weighted at nearly 60% of the DXY. The shared currency, meanwhile, is trading at its lowest versus the dollar since May 2017 after slipping below the $1.10 level earlier this month. While the Federal Reserve remains in easing mode, the European Central Bank has also shifted toward looser policy — moving to cut its deposit rate further into negative territory and restarting its bond-buying program in a controversial decision earlier this month. Nevertheless, as gloom builds around the eurozone economy, with Germany threatening to tip into recession and inflation remaining stubbornly low, many analysts see further weakness in store for the shared currency. “Until the eurozone reaches a more credible fiscal/monetary policy mix, I expect inflation expectations and EUR/USD to fall further,” said Thomas Harr, global head of fixed-income and currency research at Danske Bank, in a Monday note. Kit Juckes, global macro strategist at Societe Generale, sees the euro continuing a pattern that saw it make new cycle lows “in late April, late May, late July, late August, and now late-September.” See:No end in sight for ECB’s inflation problem “If it’s true to form, the downtrend can continue for a few more months, even if the pace is very restrained,” he wrote. “The ‘news’ isn’t new, the market’s short and bearish, and further out, forward-looking indicators are looking brighter. That said, new lows are likely in the weeks ahead.” Amazon has fired the worker at its Staten Island warehouse who organized a walkout on Monday to demand greater protections from the company amid the coronavirus outbreak.

5e6f39b64ee8d56358e714f4	Dollar stabilises after Fed cut, yen gains as traders seek safety	TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a broad range of currencies on Monday after the U.S. Federal Reserve made another surprise interest rate cut and major central banks took steps to relieve a shortage of dollars and provide extra liquidity. Pressure has been building on central banks to do something to restore calm to financial markets roiled by the deepening coronavirus crisis. The U.S. Federal Reserve cut rates to a target range of 0% to 0.25% on Sunday, U.S. time, and said it would expand its balance sheet by at least $700 billion in the coming weeks. The Bank of Japan said at an emergency meeting it would buy more corporate bonds, commercial debt and set up a new corporate lending scheme, joining the stepped up global response to the respiratory disease that has spread from China to dozens of countries and claimed more than 5,800 lives. Five other central banks cut pricing on their swap lines to make it easier to provide dollars to their financial institutions facing stress in credit markets. Some analysts said the dollar’s decline was likely to be short-lived because the shortage of dollars in the global financial system meant there would be consistent long-term demand for the greenback in the spot market. “The BOJ’s measures will provide some help to corporate financing, but unless there are matching steps from the government, banks will be reluctant to lend,” said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank in Tokyo. “More companies want to hold their dollars in cash to facilitate payments, so if you hold dollars right now you have a big advantage.” The dollar fell 1.2% to 106.70 yen on Monday, widening its losses after the BOJ’s decision. The greenback also fell 0.4% to $1.2338 per British pound. Against the euro, the dollar was little changed at $1.1126. The dollar eased 0.15% to 0.9493 Swiss franc. The Fed, the Bank of Canada, European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the BOJ and Swiss National Bank all agreed to offer three-month credit in U.S. dollars on a regular basis and at a rate cheaper than usual. The move was designed to bring down the price banks and companies pay to access U.S. dollars, which has surged in recent weeks as the coronavirus epidemic spooked investors. The Fed had already cut interest rates by half a percentage point on March 3 at an emergency meeting, the first emergency cut since the financial crisis in 2008, but that move failed to stem market volatility. Sunday’s rate cut was likely aimed at staving off what had the potential to be another volatile week in financial markets, analysts say. However, U.S. stock futures still plunged and Asian shares fell, showing investors remain nervous. [L4N2B80YP] On the China mainland, the yuan strengthened slightly to 6.9910 per dollar. The People’s Bank of China injected 100 billion yuan ($14.28 billion) into financial institutions on Monday but left borrowing cost on its medium-term loans unchanged. The move came minutes before data showed China’s retail sales, industrial output, and fixed-asset investment in January and February all tumbled. The data reveal the scale of damage caused by the coronavirus and suggest other countries could be in the same situation. Worries that travel restrictions and factory closures aimed at containing the coronavirus will cause a global recession have sent equities into a tailspin. The rapid spread of the virus in Europe and the United States has rattled investors who previously thought those regions were shielded. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand joined the global easing race with a rate cut of 75 basis points to a record 0.25%, while the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) added A$5.9 billion ($3.62 billion) to the banking system through market repo operations. The RBA said on Monday it stands ready to purchase government bonds and will announce further policy measures on Thursday. There is lingering speculation the RBA will also cut rates at some point. The New Zealand dollar fell 0.3% to $0.6039, while the Australian dollar fell 0.5% o $0.6157. Editing by Sam Holmes, Jane Wardell and Jacqueline Wong	USD
5e5d08fd73d82f5acc8afcd1	BREXIT: Hints of Clarity as the UK Enters an 11-Month Transition Period	For traders who have gotten caught up in all the news around US-China trade relations, fears of military conflict in the Middle East, the spread of coronavirus, or US company earnings, I have a reminder: The UK will officially leave the European Union on Friday, 31 January. What will change? Essentially nothing, at least at first! For the “transition period” over the rest of the year, free movement and free trade between the UK and EU will continue unencumbered. The UK will still contribute to the EU’s budget. The UK will still be obligated to abide by EU laws. The real changes won’t be felt until the end of the 11-month transition period. Between now and New Year’s Day 2021, UK and EU negotiators will have to determine the shape of a new trade pact between the two countries (not to mention UK-specific trade deals with other trading partners, including the United States), create new passports, and develop a full border/immigration plan, among countless other tasks. After it took more than three-and-a-half years, including multiple delays, to make Brexit official, color me skeptical that UK authorities will be able to iron out all of the above details this year. Market Implications Much like the (lack of) immediate changes to the general UK populace, financial markets are unlikely to see an immediate reaction to Brexit becoming official. After all, traders are a forward-looking bunch, and the formal Brexit date has been known for weeks. Therefore, market reactions to Brexit are likely to play out over a more extended timeframe. When it comes to UK markets, the ultimate impact of Brexit remains to be seen. Whether or not Brexit ultimately proves to be a net benefit for the UK economy relative to the pre-June-2016 status quo, the new state of affairs will almost certainly be an improvement over the last three years, when UK businesses and households were operating under a massive cloud of uncertainty. Not knowing the regulations, impact on international consumers, or even whether Brexit truly would take place, UK businesses have been curtailing longer-term investments, including capital equipment and hiring decisions, while UK consumers similarly put off larger purchase decisions. Therefore, as traders get more clarity on the new “rules of play” over the coming months, we may see those pent-up investments finally get made, potentially boosting UK stocks and indices. In particular, larger firms with more extensive international revenues (such as those that make up the FTSE 100) may outperform against smaller, more domestically-focused companies (such as those that make up the FTSE 250): Source: TradingView, GAIN Capital. Please note these products may not be available in all regions. When it comes to sterling, the biggest outcome of Brexit itself may be for the Bank of England, which was reticent to make any changes to monetary policy while the uncertainty around Brexit lingered. As it stands, traders are pricing in the potential for interest rate cuts this year from the BOE, but the exact timing remains an open question. If UK economic data is disappointing and the BOE is forced to make interest rate cuts sooner rather than later, GBP/USD could fall back toward previous-resistance-turned-support in the 1.2775 area. On the other hand, improving incoming figures could limit the scope, or at least delay the timeline, for any BOE interest rate cuts. In that scenario, GBP/USD could quickly run back toward its multi-year highs starting around the 1.3350 area: Source: TradingView, GAIN Capital	GBP

5e8656743f00882e4533b847	‘Quiet’ Warren Buffett has three ways to win in this market	At times like this it must be a relief to have some of your retirement portfolio managed by Warren Buffett. Granted, Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger aren’t the spring chickens they were during the dot-com crash or the global financial crisis, when they were spry youngsters in their 70s and early 80s. Today, at 89 and 96, respectively, they are part of a population vulnerable to the coronavirus as well as time. The company press office says Buffett is not planning to speak in public before May. At this juncture, their publicly traded investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, -1.29% BRK.B, -0.77% seems to offer investors three ways to win. If the stock market goes up, that should be great for the stock. Berkshire has investments in Bank of America BAC, -2.62%, Goldman Sachs GS, -2.00%, various airlines, and other companies sensitive to the economy. Berkshire Hathaway held just over $250 billion in publicly traded stock as of Dec. 31, and is currently nursing about $100 billion in paper losses on these just from the recent crash. So if there’s a quick recovery, you’d expect Berkshire stock, which has fallen from $230 to $176, to go back up quite quickly. On the other hand, if the coronavirus crisis goes on, and economic distress gets worse and worse, the company has a gigantic cash hoard of $125 billion it can use to snap up investments at bargain basement prices. (That, for illustration, is worth about $50 for each Berkshire Hathaway “B” share.) That’s how Buffett has made big money in the past, from the bear market of 1974 to the financial crisis of 2008. “Be fearful when others are greedy,” he famously advised, and “be greedy only when others are fearful.” Then there’s the third way to win. If things don’t get much worse, or much better, but bounce around indefinitely, Buffett can always use some of that cash to buy back Berkshire stock. “Over time, we want Berkshire’s share count to go down,” he reminded investors in his latest letter. The fewer the shares, the greater the proportionate interest of each one. But, he added, “Berkshire will buy back its stock only if…Charlie and I believe that it is selling for less than it is worth.” Prices in 2019 were “modestly favorable at times,” he wrote, meaning the stock was trading for substantially less than the intrinsic worth. Last year, Berkshire’s SEC filings reveal, the company bought back 4,440 of the older, and more expensive “A” shares and 17.6 million of the newer, cheaper “B” shares. Total spent: $5 billion, at an average price equivalent to $207 per B share. The highest price paid was $222. The price today: $176. Financial advisers will typically warn ordinary investors not to dabble around in individual stocks, but to stick to mutual funds — especially, these days, “index funds” with very low expense ratios. But Berkshire Hathaway isn’t really a regular stock, except in name. It’s a broadly diversified fund in all but name. Consider the range of investments. It owns stock in American Express AXP, -3.99%, Apple AAPL, -1.43%, Bank of America, Bank of New York BK, +0.32%, Charter Communications CHTR, -0.42%, Coca-Cola KO, -0.27%, Delta Air Lines DAL, -0.88%, Goldman Sachs GS, -2.00%, J.P. Morgan JPM, -2.95%, Moody’s MCO, +1.00%, Southwest Airlines LUV, -3.04%, United Continental Airlines UAL, -2.28%, U.S. Bancorp USB, -4.53%, Visa V, -3.52%, Wells Fargo WFC, -3.63%, and Kraft Heinz KHC, +2.76%. The stock in Apple alone is worth $22 per Berkshire B share. Then there are the wholly owned businesses, from car insurance giant GEICO and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, to Duracell batteries and Benjamin Moore paints, not to mention National Indemnity Insurance, Dairy Queen and See’s Candies. Berkshire’s businesses include Clayton Homes, which made 52,000 trailer, tiny and other homes last year, McLane trucking, Jordan’s Furniture, and industrial operations like Lubrizol, Marmon and Precision Castparts. There are plenty of risks and issues with the stock, naturally. Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research, says Berkshire faces a number of problems. Buffett made ill-timed bets on the airlines recently, he notes. He holds a large number of economically sensitive other stocks, particularly banking stocks. Buffett’s investment style, oriented toward traditional “value” stocks, has been out of fashion during the boom in recent years for more glamorous growth stocks. Buffett has been disposing of stock — as his charitable bequest to the Bill & Melissa Gates Foundation. Buffett (and Munger) are elderly. “What happens when he goes?,” asks Biggar. “There’s a fair amount of headline risk.” Also, Biggar adds, Buffett didn’t seem to be active in the market when stocks crashed in recent weeks. That’s normally when he makes his big moves. “He’s been a bit quiet,” says Biggar. All fair points. On the other hand, Berkshire’s stock performance has broadly kept up with the S&P 500 SPX, -1.51% over the past five and ten years, despite its “value” bias and growing cash pile. It has widely outperformed the S&P 500 Value index SP500V, -1.57% for most of that time. One might reasonably expect it to do even better if and when the Wall Street fashion swings back to “value.” (The last time that happened, in 2000-2001, the stock nearly doubled in a year, even while the broader market tanked.) And Berkshire need not replace your S&P 500 and other index funds. But it might be an addition to the portfolio. One that has a reasonable chance of zigging when others zag. And that might help you sleep a little better at night — something that’s proving a bit of a challenge for many people at the moment. Cities and communities would see economic benefit while hundreds of millions of dollars are raised for charity. Brett Arends is a MarketWatch personal finance writer.

5e5d090dbd5d9d5ac072762d	Dow Jones, S&P 500 Price Outlook: Prior Records to Act as Support	Stocks continued their climb on Wednesday even as gold broke higher and the Australian Dollar remained pressured – a theme I outlined yesterday. While some market participants have sought safety and to reduce risk exposure, it seems as though many are confident the rally can continue higher as evidenced by new records for both the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 with the Dow Jones trailing closely behind. Regardless of the fundamental foundation, it appears traders and confident in a continuation higher for equities and technical traders will rejoice as prior resistance turns to support. To that end, the Dow Jones will look to a nearby trendline that coincides with various swing lows dating back to October before the peaks in November and early December will come into play around 28,150. Interestingly, the Dow is threatening to form a trading range between 29,500 and 28,150 since it has displayed difficulty in surmounting nearby resistance. Should risk aversion reemerge and support hold, the DJIA could confirm the potential boundaries and enjoy much-needed consolidation. In the meantime, bulls may continue to probe the 29,395 and 29,500 levels. In the case of the S&P 500, bulls have been able to establish a higher-high from last week and may have their sights set at the 3,400 level. Should the ascent continue, technical traders will seek assistance around the 3,350 and 3,337 levels in the event of a modest pullback. Like the Dow Jones, subsequent support may be offered at what seems to be the lower bound of a prospective range for the index – around 3,200 for the S&P 500. Again, the index would have to slip beneath nearby support and remain between 3,337 and 3,200 for some time to establish such a range, but the makings of such a formation are certainly present. Moving forward, however, risk appetite appears persistent and retail clients are overwhelmingly bearish on US equities – a possible sign they could continue higher. With that in mind, I would argue proper risk management and close monitoring of positions is critical with the current trading landscape. --Written by Peter Hanks, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com Contact and follow Peter on Twitter @PeterHanksFX	USD
5e6f8d9cca0a9977809d77f5	Time To Bargain Hunt Airlines?	A rebound coming? We all know not to try to catch a falling knife. A rebound in aviation stocks depend largely on the duration of the outbreak. Most airlines should survive if the travel restriction and low booking levels are for just one or two quarters. Some carriers, such as Cathy Pacific are already showing early signs of life. Hong Kong arrivals were heavily affected by the coronavirus outbreak with 80% of the fleet grounded on travel restrictions and waning demand. However quick smart action has seen the spread of the virus and the fatality rate come quickly under control. The number of flights is cautiously increasing. Using past outbreaks as a guide tourism and leisure travel return fast after a virus outbreak, potentially as soon as the summer, easily stimulated by fare sales Business travel, however, could see more permanent changes as companies cut right back and focus on teleconferencing over business travel. Time for bargain hunting? It is still too early to call the bottom on airline stocks. This could well get worse before it gets better. The IAG has dropped 70% but the outlook is not 70% worse today than at the start of the year. Let's not forget IAG made £2.89 billion operating profit last year. The share price drop is a drop driven by sentiment rather than financials. There will be a time for hunting Airline bargains. But it is not quite yet. Norwegian Air is considered to be particularly at risk, potentially only surviving the next few weeks. US airline Delta is considered to be in a strong position as a highly profitable airline.	USD
5e8ae4779ffc551e9d51d60e	Asian markets gain on glimmers of progress in battling coronavirus	Asian shares and U.S. futures rebounded on Monday as investors grasped at threads of hope that the battle against the coronavirus pandemic may be making some progress in some hard-hit areas. The Nikkei 225 NIK, -2.33% in Tokyo gained 2.2% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng HSI, +1.37% rose 1%. South Korea’s Kospi 180721, -1.87% added 2.5% while the S&P/ASX 200 XJO, +3.46% in Sydney advanced 3.3%. Shares also rose in Taiwan Y9999, -0.57% and Southeast Asia. Shanghai’s market was closed for a public holiday. In New York, S&P 500 futures ES00, -1.21% were about 3% higher. The gains followed another Friday session of losses after the U.S. said employers cut 701,000 more jobs than they added last month, the first drop in nearly a decade. Investors fled the market ahead of the weekend. Oil prices were higher. Reports showed the number of people dying appeared to be slowing in New York City, Spain and Italy. The news was cautiously welcomed by leaders, who also noted that any gains could easily be reversed if people did not continue to adhere to strict lockdowns. “Hundreds of people are passing away each day from the pandemic, but less so than previous days, giving markets hope that the lockdown measures are finally starting to prove effective,” Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a commentary. “Like the rest of the world, financial markets are searching for any slivers of hope,” he said. The situation has deteriorated in other areas as rates of infections have surged. Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was expected to announce a state of emergency on Tuesday to further curb public activity and contain the outbreak. Thailand’s government was reported to be considering expanding its 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. New York’s first reaction to Friday’s appalling U.S. jobs report was to take it in stride. But Wall Street slid throughout the day as investors braced for more bad news. The losses accelerated after New York’s governor announced the biggest daily jump yet for deaths caused by the coronavirus in the country’s hardest-hit state. The S&P 500 SPX, +1.44% fell 1.5% to 2,488.65. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.22% lost 1.7% to 21,052.53, and the Nasdaq COMP, +0.77% shed 1.5%, to 7,373.08. Small-company stocks fell far more than the rest of the market. The S&P 500 is down 26.5% since its record set in February, reflecting the growing assumption that the economy is sliding into a sudden, extremely sharp recession. Traders are bracing for further potential doses of bad news: Potentially scary events on the calendar include Thursday’s weekly report on applications for unemployment benefits, which has been the closest thing to a real-time measure of how ferociously layoffs have swept the country. Companies will also soon begin reporting their profits for the first three months of the year, with reporting season beginning in earnest in two weeks. Friday’s jobs report likely didn’t fully capture the extent of the recent job losses, which have been accelerating by the day, because it collected data from before stay-at-home orders were widespread. The panic selling that dominated the first few weeks of the sell-off has eased a bit since Washington unleashed massive amounts of aid to help markets and the economy. The Federal Reserve has promised to buy as many Treasury securities as it takes to keep lending markets running smoothly, and Congress approved a $2.2 trillion rescue plan for the economy. But only a peak in the number of new coronavirus cases could lend some clarity on how deep and protracted the economic downturn will be. The United States has more than 377,000 confirmed cases of the virus, leading the worldwide tally of more than 1.25 million compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Energy markets have recovered somewhat on expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia might tone down their price war. However, benchmark U.S. crude CL.1, +0.13% was lower on Monday, falling $1.52 to $26.82 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Friday, it climbed 11.9% to $28.34 per barrel, adding on to its nearly 25% surge the day before. Brent crude BRNM20, -2.03% , the international standard, gave up $1.06 to $33.05 per barrel. It rose $4.17 on Friday to $34.11 a barrel. The world is awash in oil as demand for energy collapses, and President Donald Trump said Thursday that the rivals may be close to cutting back on production to prop up oil’s price. In currency trading, the dollar USDJPY, -0.36% rose to 108.87 Japanese yen from 108.48 yen on Friday. Amid some signs of hope that the coronavirus infection rate is plateauing, New York is still wrapping up its worst week in deaths so far since the outbreak began. Officials announced Sunday that the daily death toll for the state topped 700 in the state for the sixth straight day. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc. All rights reserved.

5e95587028df1762c643181b	NZD/USD now eyes a test of 0.6150 – UOB	"FX Strategists at UOB Group suggested NZD/USD could now by headed towards the 0.6150 region in the next weeks. 24-hour view: “Our expectation for NZD to “drift lower towards the bottom of the expected 0.6025/0.6100 range first” did not materialize as it traded between 0.6060 and 0.6112. The underlying tone has firmed somewhat and this could lead to NZD edging higher towards 0.6125. For today, the next resistance at 0.6150 is unlikely to come into the picture. Support is at 0.6070 but the stronger level is at 0.6035."" Next 1-3 weeks: “The sudden surge in NZD late last week came as a surprise as it blew past the top of our expected 0.5820/0.6020 range and hit a high of 0.6103 last Friday. While overbought short-term conditions could lead to a couple of days of consolidation first, NZD could continue to advance later on towards 0.6150. Only a break of 0.5975 would indicate that the current upward pressure has eased.”"	NZD
5e947af3261f5d638694986a	Cities in serious trouble as people can't pay property taxes	Cities are struggling with falling revenues and property tax collections. City research in Vancouver shows found 25% of residents can't pay property taxes and a whopping 50% struggle with rent. The story is not just about Vancouver, Canada. Rather it applies to cities globally, all facing a similar setup. Please consider Vancouver Mayor is Worried Over Property Tax Collection. Kennedy Stewart said Sunday the city could lose up to $500 million from its operating budget, which would be “absolutely devastating.” “If we lost half a billion dollars in revenue, we would have to really burn through all our stand-by cash we have, all our reserves, and we may even have to sell some city lands in order to meet all our obligations, so it’s a very serious situation,” he said. In addition to property tax concerns, sales tax and fee collections are in the gutter, everywhere. And if people struggle to pay the rent, landlords in turn cannot pay their bills, including property taxes. This setup is not unique to Vancouver. It's playing out across the US and Canada.	CAD
5e825cd6facc4c641d9e815a	Is China in a Recovery?	In a few hours, China will release their “Official” NBS Manufacturing PMI data for March. The expectation is for a reading of 45, which is still in contraction territory. However, a print of 45 is much better than the previous reading of 35.7. (A reading above 50 means the economy is in expansion and a reading below 50 means the economy is on contraction.) In addition, the “Official” Non-Manufacturing PMI for March is also going to be released. There is not an estimate for this figure, however the previous reading was 29.6. The reason I say “Official” is because this data is put out by the Chinese government. Depending on who you ask, these readings may or may not be accurate as they could be. The more accurate data may come on Thursday, when the private company Caixin Global puts out their survey reading. Ironically, Caixin is expecting a reading of 45.8, slightly better than expectation on of the “Official” reading. Regardless, with cononavirus cases falling in China, and with factories and stores reopening, the number is likely to be better than last months! If the data is worse than expected, the US Dollar may continue to advance vs the Chinese Yuan. The USD/CNH had put in a high of 7.1959 on September 3, 2019 and began forming a sideways channel, hitting a low 0f 6.8456 on January 20th. After breaking out of a descending wedge (and retesting the bottom of the channel on March 9th), the pair shot higher back towards the top of the channel and is currently consolidating in a pennant formation. Price consolidations in a pennant formation usually break out is the same direction of the previous move. Therefore, we should look for a breakout higher. Notice that as price reached the high of the pennant, the RSI was in overbought territory. This consolidation allowed for the RSI to move back within the neutral zone. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com On a 240- minute time frame we can get a better sense of support and resistance levels. First resistance is at today’s highs and the downward sloping trendline from the pennant near 7.1300. Above there is the near term high and top of the pennant at 7.1650. Finally, the all-time high from September is the third resistance level at 7.1854. First support is the upward sloping trendline from the bottom of the pennant near 7.07. Not far below that is the next level of horizontal support near 7.0571. Below there is the third level of support near the channel bottom at 6.9200. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Whether or not the “Official” Manufacturing PMI and Non-Manufacturing PMI readings are real or not, the Caixin figures will matter more. And given the price formation at the moment, watch for USD/CNH to break higher out of the pennant (and note the target is way above near 7.38!).	CNH
5e955600f6eaee56fed2b21f	BOJ considering steps to ease funding strains in April – Reuters	Citing sources with the Bank of Japan (BOJ) thinking, Reuters reports that the Japanese central bank will discuss taking further steps to ease corporate funding strains at this month's rate review. The funding stress is mainly due to the slumping sales, in the face of the coronavirus outbreak. The BOJ next meets for a rate review on April 27-28. “While discussions are still in initial stages, possible options on the table include further increases in purchases of corporate bonds and commercial paper (CP) and an expansion in the range of assets the central bank accepts as collateral in offering financial institutions loans. The focus for the BOJ is still crisis response, not what measures it can take to reflate the economy.” USD/JPY inches a few pips higher in early Europe, now trading at 107.73, almost unchanged on the day. A minor bounce in the US dollar across the board seems to be boding well for the major.	JPY
5e9561cc300c27142750aa2f	AUD/USD eases from multi-week tops, back near 0.6400 mark	The AUD/USD pair quickly retreated around 30-35 pip from five-week tops and was last seen trading with only modest gains, around the 0.6400 round-figure mark. The pair gained some follow-through traction for the seventh consecutive session and climbed further beyond 50-day SMA following the release of better-than-expected Chinese trade balance figures for the month of March. Data released this Tuesday showed China's exports improved in March and fell 6-6% YoY as compared to a 17.2% slide in the previous month. Adding to this, imports reversed the previous month's decline and rose 2.4% during the reported month. This comes on the back of a turnaround in the global risk sentiment, which coupled with a subdued US dollar demand provided a goodish lift to the China-proxy Australian dollar and lifted the pair to its highest level since March 12. The pair touched an intraday high level of 0.6432, albeit lacked any strong follow-through and started retreating from a resistance marked by 61.8% Fibonacci level of the 0.7032-0.5508 downfall, warranting some caution for bulls. It will now be interesting to see if the pair is able to attract any dip-buying or witness some profit-taking as investors remain cautious on the back of concerns over the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy. In the absence of any major market-moving economic releases from the US, the broader market risk sentiment might continue to play a key role in influencing the pair's momentum and produce some short-term trading opportunities.

5e79c330fa8b395a1e2b27c7	Dollar slips as Fed's money bazooka raises hopes of easier cash supply	TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar slipped on Tuesday on signs tight funding conditions are easing slightly after the U.S. Federal Reserve pulled out all stops to supply much needed greenback liquidity. The Fed announced unlimited quantitative easing and programmes to support credit markets on Monday in a drastic bid to backstop an economy reeling from emergency restrictions on commerce to fight the coronavirus. “We seem to have got out of a phase where everything from stocks to safe assets such as bonds and gold were sold,” said Koichi Kobayashi, chief manager of forex at Mitsubishi Trust Bank. “The dollar funding conditions are easing slightly, compared with a week ago, though I wouldn’t say things are normal. While the Fed is pumping dollars, we still need to wait and see if that money will flow to every corner of the economy.” The dollar index lost about 0.5% to 101.64, slipping further from Friday’s peak of 102.99, its highest level since January 2017. Against the yen, the dollar shed 0.6% to 110.58 yen, having hit a one-month high of 111.59 in the previous session. The euro gained 0.9% to $1.0821, bouncing back from a near three-year low of $1.0636 in the previous session. The British pound also rose 0.75% to $1.1630, up more than two cents from its 35-year low of $1.1413 set last week. The Fed, which has already expanded its balance sheet to a record level, undertook unprecedented measures to extend its “lender of last resort” power beyond Wall Street to Main Street and City Hall. It announced various programmes including purchases of corporate bonds, guarantees for direct loans to companies and a plan to get credit to small and medium-sized business. “I think the measures taken by the Fed are powerful and should help ease the crisis,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital in New York, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. “However, the markets seem to want more. I suspect once the Congress passes the economic stimulus package, it should stabilise the equity markets.” The radical steps came after U.S. money markets seized up as a broad set of market participants, from big multinational carmakers to small shop owners, hoarded dollars fearing a slump in cashflow during lockdowns in their countries. While the Fed’s move is likely to mitigate the blow for many companies in the long-run, investors remained on edge amid uncertainty about the extent of the pandemic. Coronavirus cases continued to rise exponentially in many countries, raising worries about the lack of hospital beds in some areas. Wall Street’s slide deepened on Monday as the rapidly spreading coronavirus forced more U.S. states into lockdown while Washington’s fiscal stimulus package remained stalled in the Senate. “The market is still nervous about possible moves to cash everything, including unwinding of existing derivative positions,” said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale. The three-month dollar/yen currency basis swap spread, seen as the market premium demanded for swapping yen for dollar, stood at 0.80%, down from a peak of around 1.4% last week but still far above normal levels around 0.2-0.4%. The premium persisted even after banks borrowed a record amount of dollars from the BOJ. Trading remained volatile, with the Australian dollar rose 2.0% to $0.5952, extending its recovery from a 17-year low of $0.5510 touched last week. The Mexican peso and the South African rand jumped more than 1% and many emerging market currencies gained too. Market players are looking to a raft of business sentiment surveys in Europe due later in the day for a glimpse of how the virus is affecting the real economy.

5e81b5b6c496d2354de72fe0	Stocks Rally on Positive Trade Developments	US stocks are poised to open higher after positive steps were taken in both the US -Mexican immigration disputes and after the US and Chinese held candid and constructive talks for the first time since negotiations fell apart a month ago. On Friday night, Mexico reaffirmed their commitments to reduce migration into the US by increasing enforcement on its borders and expanding a program to allow asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while their legal cases proceed. Mexico legislative body now has to pass the deal forward otherwise President Trump will reimpose the tariffs. Expectations are for the deal to pass and get done quickly. On Sunday, the Group of 20 major economies finance ministers agreed on a joint communique that pledged to use all the policies they can to protect global growth from disruptions due to trade and other tensions. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and China central bank chief Yi Gang signaled a possible turning point after having progressive conversations that seems to signal channels are open again for communication. The next key meeting is expected at the G20 summit in Japan at the end of the month between Xi and Trump. Treasuries fell as the 10-year yield rose 6.1 basis points to 2.141%, while the dollar had broad gains as gold sold off. The Mexican peso is also having its best gain in almost a year. European indexes had limited gains suggesting the region’s stocks will have a tougher time rebounding back to the April highs. UTX/RTN United Technologies (UTX) reached a deal to merge with defense contractor Raytheon which could support further M&A in the sector. The deal would create an aerospace-and-defense company that is valued over $100 billion with annual revenue of approximately $74 billion, creating a behemoth that would only trail Boeing in sales. The new company will be called Raytheon Technologies Corp. Shares of both companies are poised to open around 4% higher. The merger will see UTX’s Pratt &Whitney F-35 fighter jet engines combined with Raytheon’s Patriot missile defense systems. The new entity will have a diverse portfolio that will be nicely positioned to thrive even under weakness in defense spending. In other M&A news, Salesforce is set to buy Tableau for $15.3 billion in an all stock deal. The deal supports Salesforce push in growing their analytics offering. GBP The British pound extended declines after a wrath of UK data showed broad weakness throughout the entire economy. The headline GDP reading for the month of April was a contraction of 0.4%, much worse the -0.1% dropped eyed. Growth is not expected to deliver any surprises in the second quarter and that should make the Bank of England (BOE) job easy for the next year. Rates are unlikely going nowhere anytime soon. Production data was also abysmal with the manufacturing posting a 3.9% fall, while the industrial sector slumped 2.7%. Brexit is obviously hurting the data and the planned shutdown of plants could be alleviated once UK leaders are able to deliver a Brexit deal. Cable is now comfortably below the 1.2700 handle and if we see the 1.2550 breached, price may not find support until the 1.2400 area. Oil Russian and Saudi energy ministers held an intergovernmental commission meeting in Moscow as Russia begins to seek a better deal for Russian companies. Oil remained slightly bid after Saudi oil minister Al-Falih said there’s almost unanimous agreement in OPEC to extend production cuts and that Russia could agree before the current deal expires at the end of the month. Al-Falih and his Russian counterpart Novak could meet again at the G20 that occurs at the end of the month. If we see crude prices fall back into bear market territory, we could see the Russians capitulate in extending cuts. OPEC and allies still need to agree upon when to meet, with many pushing for the beginning of July. Today’s rally in crude stemmed more from the broader risk-on rally that came from positive trade developments. With US rig counts falling four out of the last five weeks, we could see US production ease slightly, providing an opportunity for oil to stabilize once markets properly price in weakness in global demand. Gold Gold prices are sharply lower as a plethora off positive market news on trade and M&A eliminated short-term demand for safe-havens. If today finishes out to be a steady grind higher for US equities, we could see gold fall further towards the $1,320 an ounce level. Technical traders are also waiting for a clean break of the $1,350 region, so we could see prices struggle until we a resumption in dollar weakness.

5e74e65ce8433a2e3a8d3229	Large Bounce in AUD/USD, But is it Enough?	Earlier this week, The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had an emergency monetary policy meeting, in which they cut interest rates a record low of 25bps. In addition, the RBA announced the start of their own quantitative easing program. The government also put together a fiscal stimulus plan of nearly $10 billion dollars. However, that may not be enough as the Australian government is in the process of putting together an additional fiscal package which could be larger than the first fiscal package! Australia has also closed it’s borders to permanent residents and citizens. What does this mean to the value of the AUD/USD? In the day before the RBA announcement, AUD/USD had moved lower from roughly .6000 to .5800. In early trading on Thursday morning before the announcement, price broke from roughly .5800 to .5500, a low not seen since 2002! Source: Tradingview, FOREX.COM AFTER the announcement on Thursday from the RBA, AUD/USD went bid. Over the last 2 days price moved from .5509 to a high of .5963, a move of 454 pips! However, if we look at the high to low from March 6th at .6687 to the lows on March 19th at .5504, price has only retraced to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, which is considered a shallow correction. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com To a large degree, the move lower in AUD/USD is due to both the unprecedented actions of the Australian Government and the RBA, as well as, the strong demand for US Dollars. Today the US Dollar (DXY) has pulled back a bit, after traded to a high earlier of 103. However, that has not provided much of an incentive for AUD/USD to go bid. If AUD/USD can not take out .6000, and to a larger extent the 50% retracement level at .6100, than the AUD/USD should continue to move lower! Here we make a case that if the AUD/USD cannot move higher through key, strategic levels, price would resume its move lower. As a result of the strong demand for US Dollars, the same case can be made for many other USD pairs. Watching both the DXY AND bold moves by governments and central banks will help give a better sense of direction for AUD/USD and USD pairs in general.	AUD
5e9575b19cbc8c7a49160008	India: Hard growth slump – ANZ	Impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on India’s economic activity is emerging in hard data. Economists at ANZ Bank expect a severe decline in Q1 FY21 growth. USD/INR is sitting at 76.2805. “Even after the lockdown is lifted, activity will only regain momentum slowly. A V-shaped recovery is unlikely.” “India’s fiscal deficit will not be a concern for the government in these unprecedented times, in our view. We expect another round of stimulus, focused on small businesses and sector specific assistance.” “The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will continue to do its bit. We expect another 50bp reduction in the policy repo rate, on or before their June meeting.”	INR
5e958d19137dd6726bef5627	S&P 500: Returns during the rebound are likely to be strong – JP Morgan	With the equity market having hit its last new high on February 19th of this year, the depth and speed of the market drop have been ferocious. Investors are getting increasingly used to market volatility reflecting the massive amount of uncertainty in light of COVID-19, per JP Morgan Asset Management. “On average, the stock market bottoms around 1.5 months before the peak in jobless claims and 4.5 months before the end of the recession.” “Market timing is always excruciatingly difficult, and trying to gauge when markets will bottom in this environment is no exception. Given this, even if it takes 5 years to recover to the market peak, the average annual return over that period would be 7%. If the market recovers faster, say in 3 years, that implies a 10% average annual return.” “We are in unprecedented times and with volatility expected to be elevated over the short-term, investors should be positioned with a high-quality bias throughout portfolios. Looking ahead, regardless of how long it takes, returns during the rebound are likely to be strong.”	EQUITY
5e95bacf1c2494614ec77264	Aussie drops as business confidence tanks in march	The Australian dollar eased slightly as the market reacted to the falling business confidence from the country. Data from the National Bank of Australia (NAB) showed that business confidence and business survey declined to their lowest level since the last financial crisis. This is mainly because most businesses have been forced to remain inactive during the shutdown. Still, there are signs that business activity will improve. First, the Australian government has started to partially open-up the economy. Second, trade numbers from China showed that exports and imports improved significantly in March. This could lead to more demand for Australian goods and services. The sterling declined slightly ahead of the scheduled Brexit negotiations. The virtual meeting will happen between Michel Barnier and David Frost, the two main figures in the talks. The goal will be to set the dates for the upcoming rounds of virtual meetings between the two sides. The talks are already behind schedule because of the coronavirus pandemic. According to the Financial Times, three rounds of negotiations were supposed to have happened at this stage. Still, tomorrow’s meeting will not address whether the UK will request for an extension of the post-Brexit period beyond December. European stocks were mixed today as investors waited for more direction on when the economy could reopen. Investors were also waiting for the earnings results from the United States. The German DAX rose by 1% while the FTSE and CAC fell by 0.45% and 0.20% respectively. In the United States, futures tied to the Dow Jones and Nasdaq rose by 260 and 110 points respectively. Johnson & Johnson was the first big company to release its earnings. Its net earnings rose to $5.8 billion, or $2.17 per share. This was higher than what analysts were expecting. The company also slashed its forward guidance because of the coronavirus concerns. Meanwhile, JP Morgan’s profit dropped by 69% in the first quarter as the company warned of a deep recession. The EUR/USD pair was mixed today as investors started to focus on corporate earnings and the reopening of major economies. The pair is trading at 1.0940, which is slightly lower than the intraday high of 1.0957. The pair is still between the channel shown in green below. The price is also along the middle line of the Bollinger Bands while volatility has risen. The pair may remain at the current levels as there is no major economic data scheduled today. The GBP/USD pair declined slightly as investors waited for tomorrow’s negotiations. The pair is trading at 1.2550, which is a few pips below the day’s high of 1.2580. On the four-hour chart, the index has moved above the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level. This means that the pair may continue rising and possibly test the 78.6% retracement level of 1.2725. The alternate scenario is where the pair moves lower to retest the 50% Fibonacci level at 1.2300. The AUD/USD pair eased slightly after the weak business confidence data. The pair is trading at 0.6390, which is slightly below the day’s high of 0.6445. It is also along the 14-day exponential moving average while the RSI has moved slightly below the overbought level of 70. The pair is also trading above the Ichimoku cloud. The pair may continue rising and possibly test the important resistance level of 0.6500.	GBP
5e5d08ca73d82f5acc8afc8d	GBP/USD in Rally Mode as BoJo Replaces His Finance Minister – 1.32 In Sight?	Risk assets are taking a hit this morning after China announced a 15k surge in COVID-19 (coronavirus) cases following a new diagnostic protocol, reviving fears that the outbreak may be less contained than previously assumed. That said, current data suggests that COVID-19 is less deadly than previous epidemics and generally contained to China for the moment, though risk sentiment could take another tumble if either of these assumptions is called into question in the coming days. One way or another, the disruption to economic activity in China seems poised to stretch into March at this point. Meanwhile, nearly 9,000km away in London, pound traders are more focused on domestic developments. Specifically, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson made some significant changes to his cabinet, prominently including his replacement of Finance Minister Sajid David with Rishi Sunak. At first blush, market participants believe that Sunak would be less likely to show resistance to the Prime Minister and may be more likely to institute fiscal stimulus (read: tax cuts and spending increases) than his predecessor. Expansionary fiscal policy remains the FX market’s proverbial “white whale” – with central banks increasingly resorting to untested (and so far fairly ineffective) policies across the developed world, many analysts believe that monetary policy is reaching the limits of its efficacy. Any signs that fiscal policy may be stepping up to take the baton are viewed as positive for the currency in question, and that’s why we’ve seen the pound rally to become the day’s strongest major currency. Technically speaking, GBP/USD is rallying for its fourth consecutive day, but remains in the middle of its four-month range centered at 1.30. The pair seemingly saw a “false breakdown” below the late December low at 1.2900, wrongfooting shorts and setting the stage for the near-term rally: Source: TradingView, GAIN Capital Moving forward, GBP/USD could continue to see near-term strength, especially if Johnson and Sunak hint at expanding fiscal stimulus to address the UK’s lackluster growth. To the topside, there’s little in the way of meaningful previous resistance until the year-to-date highs around 1.3200. Any reversal to break below this week’s low at 1.2880 would eliminate the near-term bullish bias and increase the odds of a continuation to the bottom of the multi-month range at 1.2775.	GBP
5e81b5ffc496d2354de73034	Sterling finds support on Brexit delay talk	Tuesday February 26: Five things the markets are talking about Global equities are trading under pressure in the overnight session, while sovereign bond prices have found a bid as investors pare back a portion of their initial euphoria surrounding the Sino-U.S trade talks. The pound (£1.3208) has found its ‘sea legs’ after U.K PM Theresa May is said to be considering a plan to delay Brexit. Brexit agenda PM May is expected to allow her cabinet to discuss extending the deadline beyond March 29 at a meeting this morning and then reveal the cabinet’s conclusions in an announcement to Parliament later (07:30 am ET). On the central bank front, Fed Chair Powell will deliver his semi-annual testimony on monetary policy and the state of the U.S economy over the next two-days (Feb 26/27) to House and Senate committees. In addition, several of his colleagues will also be speaking this week. Elsewhere, crude oil prices have extended their losses after tumbling the most in over a month so far this week on criticism from President Trump that prices are too high. On tap: U.S consumer confidence at 10 am EDT and New Zealand trade balance (04:45 pm ET). President Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un are expected to meet later today for a second summit. 1. Stocks see red In Japan, the Nikkei share average closed a tad weaker overnight, under selling pressure ahead of Japan’s fiscal year-end in March. The Nikkei ended the session down -0.37%, while the broader Topix shed -0.23%. Down-under, Aussie shares have snapped a three-session winning streak overnight, with financials and resources stocks leading broad-based losses. The S&P/ASX 200 index fell -0.9% at the close of trade, its worst session in nearly eight-weeks. The benchmark rallied +0.3% yesterday. In S. Korea, the Kospi index traded essentially flat at -0.15%. In China, stocks fell overnight in heavy volume as a percentage of investors took profits on heavyweight financial shares, believing that Monday’s “spectacular surge” is unsustainable. The CSI300 settled down -1.2% lower, while the Shanghai Composite Index fell -0.7%. The CSI300’s rise in yesterday’s session was its biggest one-day gain in three-years. In Hong Kong it was a similar story. Stocks fell, tracking other regional bourses, as investors waited to see if the U.S and China can clinch a trade deal. At the close, the Hang Seng index fell -0.7%, while the China Enterprises Index lost -0.8%. In Europe, regional indexes are following suit and trade lower along with Asia. However, the U.K’s FTSE 100 index is underperforming its regional counterparts, falling -1% as the sterling rallies against both the dollar and the EUR. U.S stocks are set to open in the ‘red’ (-0.23%). Indices: Stoxx600 % at #, FTSE -1.00% at 7,112.25, DAX -0.24% at 11,478.33, CAC-40 -0.27% at 5,217.61, IBEX-35 -0.32% at 9,174.72, FTSE MIB -0.05% at 20,426.50, SMI 0.00% at 9,402.70, S&P 500 Futures -0.23% 2. Oil eases after Trump urges OPEC to curb prices, gold unchanged Oil prices are again a tad lower, extending yesterday’s losses of more than -3% after President Trump called on OPEC+ to rein in its efforts to boost prices. Brent futures are at +$64.70 a barrel, down -6c, or -0.1% from Monday’s close, while U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures are at +$55.26 per barrel, down -22c, or -0.4%. Note: Brent plunged -3.5% in yesterday’s session. Tweeting yesterday, President Trump expressed his concern about higher oil prices (supported by production cuts) and repeated his previous calls on OPEC+ to keep prices steady. Aiding Trumps tactics is the fact that oil markets were trading higher on Sino-U.S trade optimism. With some investors cashing in on the recent equity rally overnight have naturally put commodity prices on the back foot. However, sanctions by the U.S against oil exporters Iran and Venezuela have contributed to the recent gains and should also provide a floor for prices. Ahead of the U.S open, the ‘yellow’ metal is little changed despite President Trump stating that he would delay an increase in tariffs on Chinese goods. Spot gold is flat at +$1,327.40 per ounce, while U.S gold futures are steady at +$1,329.9 per ounce. Elsewhere, Palladium hit a record high this morning, surging above +$1,550 as a threatened strike by South African mineworkers added to supply concerns in an already tight market. 3. French yields at two-year low as “yellow vest” effect wanes In this morning’s Euro session, France’s 10-year government bond yield has dropped to its lowest level in over two-years as the effect of the country’s “yellow vest” protests fade. Also aiding French bond prices is the fact that French President Macron’s popularity has recovered to levels not seen since the protests broke out three-months ago. Elsewhere, broader eurozone yields are under pressure from next week’s European Central Banks (ECB) monetary policy expectations. French 10-yea yields have dropped to +0.506%, down nearly -2 bps in the session, while the German 10-year Bund yield are hovering atop of the +0.10% mark, slightly lower on the day. Fixed income traders will take their cue from the Fed this morning (09:45 am ET). Fed chair Jerome Powell will testify to the U.S Senate on the semi-annual monetary policy report before the Senate Banking Committee. Markets will be looking for signs on potential interest rate hikes this year and that U.S policymakers will stop running down the central bank’s balance sheet. The yield on 10-year Treasuries has declined -1 bps to +2.65%, while in the U.K, the 10-year Gilt yield has advanced less than +1 bps to +1.18%. 4. Sterling finds support on Brexit delay talk The pound is rallying after reports that U.K PM Theresa May is considering a plan to delay the country’s scheduled departure from the EU next month. Sterling (£1.3203) was recently +0.7% stronger against the U.S dollar. With a little more than a month to go before the UK’s scheduled exit from the E.U, lawmakers have yet to settle on a deal with the bloc. Yesterday, the Labour Party said it would be prepared to back a second Brexit referendum, adding to uncertainty about the path the UK will take in the coming weeks. Elsewhere, the ‘big’ dollar continues to hover atop of its one-month lows (C$1.3207, €1.1362, ¥110.86) and seems well contained within recent quarterly ranges for G10 currency pairs. Dealers have shifted their focus to Fed Chair Powell’s semi-annual testimony to Congress – will we hear more ‘dovish’ comments from the central banker? 5. Hong Kong exports down for a third consecutive month Data earlier this morning showed that Hong Kong’s export-oriented economy suffered further from Sino-U.S trade tensions as outbound shipments fell year-over-year for a third consecutive month in January. The headline print showed a -0.4% decline which was still better that the December -0.5% drop. The city’s government says the external environment is “still challenging,” noting moderating economic growth in many key trading partners will likely weigh on Hong Kong’s merchandise exports near-term. Note, imports dropped -6% from January 2018. This article is for general information purposes only. It is not investment advice or a solution to buy or sell securities.

5e5d075a12282357b8431966	Blowout fear for FX markets as coronavirus stirs dormant vol trades	LONDON (Reuters) - With this week’s coronavirus-driven rout having shaken awake previously slumbering euro-dollar markets, the spotlight is back on the “short volatility” trades that some regulators fear could trigger a blowup on world markets. The world’s most traded currency pair, comprising a quarter of global FX volumes, has become increasingly becalmed in recent years, and volatility gauges embedded in euro-dollar options tumbled in January to historic sub-4% lows from 7.3% a year earlier. The pair’s trading range last year - $1.15 to $1.09 - was the narrowest in the euro’s two-decade history, to the displeasure of currency traders who can wring out more profits in volatile markets, often by selling hedging products to clients. Their mood may have been improved by a rise in euro-dollar implied volatility to back above 6%, the highest in nearly six months. But there’s some trepidation too as memories stir of the ‘Volmageddon’ crisis of February 2018 when the short equity volatility trade imploded, sending investors scrambling to recoup losses and triggering a huge Wall Street selloff. With regard to positioning linked to currency markets, any sharp rise in volatility would hit those who have shorted vol by selling options, as well as those who bought more risky assets, betting exchange rate swings would decline or stay stable. “It makes us more nervous because it is indicative of a build-up of positioning,” said a central bank official who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, referring to investors buying risky financial assets. The worry is that the extended low-vol backdrop ups the risk of a blowout that ripples across all the sectors that benefited from FX calm. The official said no plan of action was in place, but that central banks were monitoring the potential implications of a vol spike, adding: “When these things unwind, they do so in a sharp manner - up the stairs and down the elevator.” The issue is clearly on regulators’ minds. One senior FX trader who sits on a major central bank’s foreign exchange committee said it was the number one topic at a recent meeting of industry and policy executives. The Bank of England and European Central Bank declined comment. The New York Federal Reserve did not return calls and emails seeking comment. So opaque is the currency trading world that no concrete data exists on positioning, but the dealer said “a lot of people” were short volatility, with the consensus view that low vol was here to stay thanks to low interest rates worldwide. “We want volatility to increase but what we don’t want is a shock. I don’t think anyone wants a shock,” the person added. Measures of currency activity have been falling since the 2008 financial crisis, as central bank liquidity taps have gushed, inflation fallen and policies moved more or less in lockstep. To a layman, extended currency calm may sound like a good idea. But it can tempt market makers, including hedge funds, to lever up and buy riskier, less liquid securities, a trend noted in the International Monetary Fund’s financial stability report. The issue also highlights how loosely regulated the $6.6 trillion-a-day forex market is. Unlike in equity markets, there are few ways to accurately measure positioning whether in spot currency markets or derivatives. “We don’t know, in the context of a global recession and associated market selloff, how resilient the fund industry will be,” Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF’s monetary and capital markets department, told Reuters, warning of a “potentially destabilising” situation. “Our policy advisory is that regulators should monitor potential risk and that they should take actions pre-emptively in order to protect financial stability,” he added. The Bank of International Settlements too, writing just after Volmageddon, likened short vol strategies to “collecting pennies in front of a steamroller”. The rush into short-vol is partly because traders, deprived of money-making opportunities, turned to selling currency options which earned them a small premium. Such trades can yield handsome profits - for instance, shorting euro to buy equal weights of the dollar, rouble and Brazilian real would have made 11.5% in 2018/2019, Refinitiv data shows. Essentially a short bet on euro volatility, that trade would have generated a Sharpe ratio of 2.5, versus 1.7 in 2015-2016 when vol was in the double-digits. Sharpe ratio refers to returns earned above risk-free rates after adjusting for volatility. But if the picture turns, the impact can be gigantic. The 2018 Volmageddon was blamed on punters betting on lower equity volatility through short positions in VIX futures, akin to buying options aimed at shorting FX vol. Mizuho analysts reckon the 1.3% yen rout on Feb 19 this year may have stemmed from investors buying back some short dollar positions as volatility grew higher. Traders are still relatively relaxed about the risk of a near-term volatility surge, however, especially given past such warnings have fallen flat. Relatively stable economic growth and stagnant inflation metrics mean low volatility is normal, the IMF’s Adrian argued. And finally, those who favour selling vol are confident central banks will step in to smooth out any market turmoil, with markets already betting the Fed and other central banks will cut interest rates in response to the coronavirus.

5e81b5b6c496d2354de72fea	Dollar rallies from multi week lows	Tuesday May 28: Five things the markets are talking about On the whole, global equities have advanced in the overnight session along with U.S equity futures as investors and traders return from a U.S and a U.K bank holiday. The ‘big’ dollar has found some traction with U.S Treasuries, while crude oil trades mixed along with gold. Tit for Tatt There has been no progress in global trade talks – China, U.S Europe or Japan – according to President Trump the U.S is not ready to make a deal, so much so that American tariffs on Chinese goods “could go up very, very substantially, very easily.” On the other hand, China has been trying to play down the impact of the trade war on its economy, saying higher tariffs will have a “very limited” impact, and would hurt the U.S about as much. On tap: NZD financial stability report, ANZ Business confidence, RBNZ Gov. Orr speaks (May 28), BoC monetary policy announcement, AUD private capital expenditure & NZD annual budget release (May 29), CH, Fr. & DE bank holiday, US preliminary GDP & CNY manufacturing PMI (May 30), CAD GDP (May 31). 1. Stocks see the light In Japan, the Nikkei rallied overnight as gains in European markets Monday improved sentiment, while activity in the gaming sector “shot up on hopes for a new gaming title.” The Nikkei share average ended +0.4% while the broader Topix rose +0.3%. Down-under, Aussie equities beat a three-session losing run overnight as mining stocks rallied on firmer iron ore prices. The S&P/ASX 200 index finished the session +0.5% higher. The benchmark closed 4.1 points lower on Monday. In S. Korea, the Kospi index added +0.13%. In China, stocks closed higher for a second consecutive session overnight, as officials downplayed the impact of the trade war with the U.S, and as foreign investors bought shares ahead of an increase in MSCI’s weighting. The blue-chip CSI300 index rose +1.0%, while the Shanghai Composite Index closed up +0.6%. In Hong Kong, stocks ended higher after falling to a four-month low yesterday, but gains are capped as investor sentiment remains fragile over trade and economic growth. The Hang Seng index rose +0.4%, while the China Enterprises Index gained +0.1%. In Europe, regional bourses trade mixed as investors continue to digest results from the EU elections. The FTSE is little changed having been closed yesterday. U.S stocks are set to open small in the ‘red’ (-0.19%) Indices: Stoxx600 -0.37% at 375.32, FTSE -0.06% at 7,273.25, DAX -0.40% at 12,023.21, CAC-40 -0.49% at 5,310.08, IBEX-35 -0.67% at 9,155.08, FTSE MIB -1.14% at 20,131.50, SMI -0.40% at 9,673.80, S&P 500 Futures -0.19% 2. Oil mixed as OPEC cuts and sanctions prop up prices, but trade worries weigh With traders back at their desks, the crude oil price story has not changed. Oil prices are mixed as supply cuts, led by OPEC+ and U.S sanctions – Iran and Venezuela – support crude, while concerns about an economic slowdown weighe on the market. Brent crude futures are at +$69.99, down -12c, or -0.2%, from the last close, when they rose +2.1%. U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures are at +$59.03 per barrel, up +40c, or +0.7%, from Friday’s close. Note: Last week, both crude contracts registered their biggest price declines this year amid concerns that the U.S-China trade dispute could accelerate into a global economic slowdown. Price action remains a ‘push-pull’ trade with the crude ‘bear’ getting a helping hand from slowing demand growth due to the negative impact on the global economy of the Sino-U.S trade war, while the crude ‘bull’ has been relying on escalating political tensions between the U.S and Iran, as well as ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC+. Expect investors to take their cues from this week’s API and EIA inventory reports which are a day later reporting due to the U.S Memorial Holiday. Ahead of the U.S open, gold prices have eased a tad, dropping for the first time in four sessions, as the ‘big’ dollar rebounds from multi-week lows amid simmering Sino-U.S trade tensions. Spot gold is down -0.2% at +$1,282.86 per ounce, while U.S gold futures are down -0.1% at +$1,281.80 an ounce. 3. German Bund yield falls to a 3-year low Ten-year Bund yields have hit fresh three-year lows this morning as market sentiment remains cautious in the aftermath of the European Parliament elections over the weekend even as the next parliament will remain pro-European, albeit more fragmented and with more-pronounced changes in some countries. The yield is down -2 bps at -0.142%, encroaching on 2016’s record low of -0.20%. Expect some relief for Euro yields as new product come to market this week – Germany will launch a two-year, €5B Schatz while Italy will sell zero-coupon notes and inflation-linked bonds. Dealers will need to make some room to take down product. Elsewhere, the yield on 10-year Treasuries fell -3 bps to -2.29%, the lowest in more than 19-months, while in the U.K, the 10-year Gilt yield has fallen -4 bps to +0.956%, the lowest in more than two-years. 4. Dollar rallies from multi week lows The greenback reached session highs overnight in Asia, supported mostly by Trump’s comment about the U.S being “not ready” to cut a trade deal with China. It put pressure on trade-linked currencies besides weighing on the yuan again. AUD (A$0.6918) is tad softer on Trumps comments that American tariffs on Chinese goods “could go up very, very substantially, very easily”. The AUD is expected to continue to remain in a tight range. Next week’s expected RBA rate cut (June 4) is unlikely to be a major catalyst for AUD prices, unless the accompanying RBA statement provides guidance of further RBA rate cuts. GBP/USD (£1.2670) – Brexit continues to dominate the U.K headlines and the possibility that a ‘hard’ Brexiteer taking the reins from PM May has sterling bears looking for opportunities to short the pound once again. EUR/USD (€1.1192) is currently hovering just below the psychological €1.12 handle and the techies believe the single unit will trade in its recent contained trading range unless more volatility comes in from Italy or Brexit. On the data front, the week is not throwing up anything of significant interest. 5. Solid Q1 economic growth in Switzerland Data this morning showed that Swiss GDP growth exceeded expectations in Q1 on broad gains in consumption, investment and exports. Swiss GDP advanced +0.6% from Q4 and +1.7% from a year earlier, well above market expectations. Analysts expect todays figures should ease any pressure on the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to launch further policy easing, but with inflation still “super low” the SNB should be in no hurry to raise its -0.75% policy rate.

5e5d07bc203be655205b7acf	Japan stocks plunge more than 3% as virus fears grow; Malaysia markets edge higher despite political chaos	Stocks in Japan saw sharp declines on Tuesday following an overnight plunge on Wall Street as fears of the economic impact from the coronavirus outbreak spread. Returning from a Monday holiday, the Nikkei 225 closed 3.34% lower at 22,605.41 as shares of index heavyweight Fast Retailing dropped 4.15%. Earlier in the session, the index had plummeted almost 4%. The Topix index also declined 3.33% to end its trading day at 1,618.26. Shares of Fujifilm bucked the overall trend to gain 2.83% after local media reports that the Japanese government was considering the use of an anti-flu drug developed by a unit of the firm to treat the coronavirus. Shares in mainland China were mixed on the day, with the Shanghai composite shedding 0.6% to around 3,013.05 while the Shenzhen component added 0.71% to 11,856.08. The Shenzhen composite gained 0.507% to about 1,943.17. South Korea’s Kospi closed 1.18% higher at 2,103.61, following sharp losses seen on Monday as the country witnessed a spike in the number of coronavirus cases in recent days. On Tuesday, the country reported 60 new cases, bringing the number of infected cases to 893, to become the country with the most cases outside mainland China. Total fatalities now stand at 8. Seoul raised the coronavirus alert to the “highest level” over the weekend. Shares of Korean Air Lines rose 1.58% on Tuesday despite the airline announcing Tuesday that a cabin crew member had tested positive for the coronavirus, according to Reuters. Consumer confidence in South Korea dropped in February to a six-month low, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported Tuesday. The Composite Consumer Sentiment Index for February fell to 96.9, declining 7.3 points from its reading in January, according to data from the Bank of Korea. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was about 0.2% higher, as of its final hour of trading. Meanwhile, shares in Australia declined as the S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.6% to close at 6,866.60. Overall, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index was 0.2% higher. Elsewhere, markets in Malaysia were watched on Tuesday following recent developments that thrust the country into political uncertainty. The country’s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad unexpectedly resigned on Monday, but reportedly agreed to stay on as interim leader until a successor is named. In afternoon trade on Tuesday, the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index rose about 0.7%, after closing about 2.69% lower on Monday following news of the political upheaval. The country’s central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia or BNM, said it was “closely monitoring conditions in the financial markets” after the latest political developments. “While ringgit movements will continue to be market determined, BNM’s market operations will ensure sufficient liquidity and orderly financial market conditions,” it said in a statement. In China, where the outbreak was first reported, 508 new cases and 71 additional deaths were reported as of Feb. 24. That brings the country’s total to 77,658 confirmed cases, and 2,663 deaths. Concerns over the economic impact of disruptions caused by the virus outbreak have sent jitters across markets in recent weeks as some factories in China continue to remain shut due to containment measures. Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered Bank, told CNBC’s “Street Signs” on Tuesday that China’s first quarter GDP is expected to deteriorate “very materially” to only 2.8% while the full-year projection was at 5.5%. “This will be lower than the minimum GDP growth which is required to achieve so-called doubling GDP by 2020 target at 5.7%,” Liu said. “From what we have seen so far this year, nothing is growing aside (from) something very small … such as online gaming,” she said. “Even if the virus condition start(s) to get contained and we have real activities picking up in March, it’s very difficult to see China having any material growth in the foreseeable future.” The outbreak in South Korea has also exacerbated concerns, given the country’s importance in the global technology and semiconductor supply chains. “We’ve already seen how the China factory shutdowns have affected industry in the rest of the region as they haven’t been able to get the intermediate goods that feed into their … production lines,” said Alex Holmes, Asia economist at Capital Economics. While the effect on South Korea won’t be as broad, “if they had to shut down factories across the country, then particularly the technology sector across the rest of the region who rely on Korea for things like … liquid crystal displays and semiconducting chips, they would really struggle,” Holmes told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Tuesday. Outside of Asia, Italy has also seen a surge in the number of people infected, with at least 130 reported cases. “The jump in cases outside of China raises the risk of a sharper Q1 2020 global economic slowdown,” Kim Mundy, currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote in a note. “It also raises the risk that the economic disruption is more prolonged.” Overnight on Wall Street, fears of coronavirus contagion sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging 1,031.61 points to close at 27,960.80. The S&P 500 slipped 3.35% to end its trading day at 3,225.89 while the Nasdaq Composite closed 3.71% lower at 9,221.28. The steep sell-off on Monday left the Dow giving up its gain for 2020, with the index now down 2% for the year. The S&P 500 also had its worst day in two years and wiped out its year-to-date gain as well. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was at 99.31 after touching highs around 99.6 yesterday. The Japanese yen traded at 110.84 per dollar after strengthening from levels above 111.2 yesterday. The Australian dollar changed hands at $0.6617 following its decline from levels above $0.67 last week. — CNBC’s Fred Imbert and Yen Nee Lee contributed to this report.

5e5e74c28490377e724b7af7	US Dollar, Dow & Gold React as Fed Delivers Shock 50bps Cut	The Fed has your back – at least that is what the US central bank wants markets to think. FOMC officials just unanimously announced a 0.5% interest rate cut (i.e. 50-bps) to shore up market confidence and keep financial conditions accommodative. The decision to lower rates came unexpectedly and outside of routine Federal Reserve meetings scheduled for this year. The last time the Fed delivered an emergency rate cut was in August 2008 amid the global financial crisis and collapse of Lehman Brothers, but follows the coordinated G7 meeting of global finance ministers earlier today. Although market participants have increasingly priced in dovish FOMC action over recent trading sessions, which comes in response to mounting coronavirus concerns, traders were likely caught off-guard by the latest inter-meeting Fed interest rate cut. This is being reflected by the violent reaction in assets across the risk-spectrum such as the US Dollar, Dow Jones and gold. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView USD price action quickly cratered to session lows and pushed the US Dollar Index (DXY) down to the 97.00 handle before the shock Fed rate cut induced selloff stabilized. Tuesday’s sharp drop in the US Dollar relative to major currency pairs is exacerbating recent downside recorded by the Greenback. After notching its strongest reading in roughly three years, the broader US Dollar is now trading at its weakest level since early January after its 2.9% drop over the last eight sessions. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView The US stock market – measured via the Dow Jones Index – welcomed news of the surprise FOMC rate cut. The DJIA popped about 2.5% off of session lows to the 27,000 price level subsequent to the unforeseen interest rate cut from the Fed. Although major equity indices initially jumped back into the green, stocks have since edged back lower as traders digest the news. The move back lower might be explained by overarching cynicism amongst investors who are likely questioning the motivation behind the Federal Reserve’s decision. For example, how bad is the economy if a surprise 0.5% rate cut is truly warranted – particularly after already slashing the target Federal funds rate by 0.75% since last July. Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView The reaction in spot gold price action to the surprise Fed rate cut was quite notable as well. Bullion bounced in excess of 2% after news of the shock interest rate cut crossed the wires. The precious metal is now trading comfortably back above the $1,600 per ounce price level following the bullish fundamental development. Gold prices tend to rise as interest rates fall. Market participants now turn to an upcoming press conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who will be speaking live on the subject at 1600 GMT.

5e7dd5d88bd08f7d91360720	Jobless claims shock markets	The shockingly high number of new jobless claims in the US yesterday has poured icy water on the market's recent rallies, causing the FTSE and other European gauges to open lower. Rising to 3.3 million from only 281,000 last week, the number was at the high end of expectations fuelling concerns about how much worse the situation in the US economy could become before the corona crisis is over. The most worrying aspect is that at 85,000 corona cases in the US, more than during the whole three months of the outbreak in China, the virus is only beginning to demonstrate its full strength and then only in a few of the US largest cities. In London, house builders are under pressure after the UK government effectively suspended the property market by banning estate agents from marketing new homes and asking them to stop arranging visits for properties on sale. The move came as a request from banks which were concerned about lending in the current environment. Travel firms are also struggling as the spread of the virus worsens. The safe haven assets are yet again thin on the ground and only United Utilities and gold miner Polymetal are trading in the black, by a small margin. Oil producers in a corner The irony in the oil market is that in January, at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, Russia rejected Saudi Arabia’s suggestion to cut production to bolster the decline in oil price. Russia stalled on its answer and eventually said it would increase its sales in April. Now that prices have more than halved from over $60 to a band between $26-$28 Russia is talking about cutting a deal with OPEC producers to pump less oil from next month. With oil prices at current lows, old hatchets may end up being buried, particularly as the spread of the virus speeds up across the globe. Brent crude is holding just a whisker above $26 which is proving a good resistance level, that has been breached only briefly this week before returning above it.	USD

This amounts to a 23% reduction in output by these members.” “This should help support prices in the short term, and it significantly reduces the risk of prices dropping into the teens as it officially ends the price war that Saudi Arabia and Russia started only a month ago.” “Crude oil futures will likely find some stability on this news this week. But we suspect any rally will be relatively short lived, as the reality of the situation dawns on traders.

5e7e07a13d69d46eb0e8949b	GBP/USD: Elliott Wave Analysis And Forecast For 27/03/2020 – 03/04/2020	The GBP/USD pair is in correction, still likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a level of 1.2528. Main scenario: short positions will be relevant from corrections below the level of 1.2528 with a target of 1.1177 – 1.0687 once the correction is completed. Alternative scenario: breakout and consolidation above the level of 1.2528 will allow the pair to continue the rise up to the levels of 1.3196 – 1.3509. Analysis: Supposedly, the fifth wave of senior level V continues developing on the daily time frame, with a correction completed in the form of wave (2) of V inside. The third wave (3) of V is developing on the H4 time frame, with wave 3 of (3) formed inside. Apparently, an ascending correction is nearing completion in the form of wave 4 of (3) on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels 1.1177 – 1.0687 once the correction’s over. The level of 1.2528 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3196 – 1.3509	GBP
5e8e99b9f15fce269f68ee10	Commodity currencies hold firm on hopes of pandemic peak, oil output cut	TOKYO (Reuters) - Commodity currencies drew support on Thursday from hopeful signs the coronavirus pandemic may be peaking and that major oil producers may agree to cut output to stem a plunge in oil prices. The Australian dollar fetched $0.6225 AUD=D4, down slightly but still near its highest level since mid-March, maintaining most of its gains since rallying from a 17-year trough of $0.5510 touched three weeks ago. The dollar’s index against six other major currencies stood flat at 100.15 =USD in early Thursday trade. The index is down 0.6% so far this week as safe-haven flows to the U.S. currency eased on rising hopes much of Europe and the United States could soon see themselves out of the worst period of the COVID-19 pandemic. “New York reported its biggest death toll while infections hit the highest level in four days in Spain and three days in Italy,” said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan market research at JPMorgan. “All these are negative but forecasts both from governments and experts that the peak could come within days are leading markets not to focus on those details.” New York state on Wednesday reported the most coronavirus cases in the world, overtaking Spain, according to a Reuters tally. The market’s focus is now on U.S. initial jobless claims data [USJOB=ECI] due at 1230 GMT. The average forecasts of economists stood at 5.25 million after a total of nearly 10 million claims over the past two weeks. “Markets already know that the economy is being hit by extraordinary shocks,” said JPMorgan’s Sasaki. “Even if the number increases, it will probably surprise few people while a better reading could enhance the perception that the worst may be over and trigger a bigger market reaction.” On top of hopes of a peak in the epidemic, commodity-linked currencies, including the Aussie, got an additional boost from hopes that major oil producing countries could agree to cut output at a video conference on Thursday. The Canadian dollar CAD=D4 traded at C$1.4025 per U.S. dollar, not far off this week's peak at C$1.3945. The Canadian currency has been recovering from a four-year low of C$1.4669 hit on March 20. The Norwegian Krone also strengthened slightly, trading at 11.1205 per euro EURNOK=, near its highest since mid-March and having gained almost 19% from a record low hit on March 19. Media reports suggested Russia would cut its output and Algeria’s energy minister said he expected a “fruitful” meeting though there remained tensions between the world’s top three producers, the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia. “Markets are now looking to the meeting of OPEC Plus. Some people are having high expectations but getting a deal could be tricky,” said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of currency trade at Societe Generale in Tokyo. The euro was flat at $1.0858 EUR=, having slipped 0.35% on Wednesday, after European Union finance ministers failed in all-night talks to agree on more economic support for their coronavirus-stricken economies. Two main sticking points were conditions for access to emergency credit lines in the euro zones’s bailout fund and the notion of issuing joint debt by the bloc, so-called “coronabonds”. The yen was little moved at 108.94 yen per dollar JPY=, having traded in a narrowing range so far this week. “While the dollar/yen is supported by the overall risk-on mood, there is selling from Japanese exporters above 109 yen, which will likely limit the chance of a big break above that level,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.

5e94a65178c8bd46bb632749	USD/CAD finds resistance ahead of 1.4000, slumps to 1.3930 region	The USD/CAD pair advanced to a daily high of 1.3987 during the American session but failed to preserve its momentum. As of writing, the pair was trading near the lower limit of its daily range around 1.3930, erasing 0.15% on the day. Crude oil prices started the new week under modest selling pressure after the deal reached by OPEC+ and other producers to cut the oil reduction by 9.7 million barrels per day failed to convince investors. Although the WTI staged a rebound to $24 after Saudi energy minister said the effective oil supply cuts could reach 19.5 million barrels per day, it dropped below $23 in the last hour to help the pair limit its losses. The next significant catalyst for the CAD will be the Bank of Canada's monetary policy announcements on Wednesday. Markets expect the BoC to keep its interest rate unchanged at 0.25% and investors will focus on the press conference. Meanwhile, the US Dollar Index, which fell sharply last week after the Fed announced new measures to help the economy with loans totalling $2.3 trillion, is staying flat near 99.50 area on Monday to reflect the subdued market action.

5e69aadf865fe511682ba28f	Dollar slides after Trump bans travel from Europe to fight virus	SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The euro held its nerve on Thursday, as markets wait to see how aggressively the European Central Bank will move to combat the coronavirus’ economic shock, following emergency rate cuts in the U.S. and Britain. Investors expect the ECB will cut its main deposit rate by 10 basis points. But it is no certainty since rates are already at a record-low -0.5% and further cuts could hurt bank margins and so squeeze lending. Markets also await 0100 GMT remarks from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has downplayed the risks from coronavirus, but said he would address economics and healthcare in his comments. The euro was flat in Asian trade at $1.1260, its softest so far in a week where it has soared on expectations of further rate cuts in the United States. Futures markets have priced the lower band of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s funds rate hitting zero by May. <0#FF:> Sterling meanwhile nursed modest losses after the Bank of England made a surprise half-a-percentage-point rate cut in tandem with a $39 billion government stimulus package. It last sat at $1.2815. “There’s a sense to which currency markets are going to reward the currencies of countries that are seen to be using whatever space they’ve got for easier fiscal and monetary policy,” said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB. “(But) even if the ECB wheel out a cocktail of lower rates, stepped up QE, more long-term ... in itself, that’s not going to inspire a huge amount of confidence that the eurozone economy is going to escape recession. The hope would be that we’ll have something more tangible on the fiscal side sooner rather than later.” A press conference is due at 1230 GMT in Frankfurt, following the monetary policy meeting. Elsewhere, the dollar advanced against commodity currencies and nursed losses on the safe-haven yen amid a slew of dire headlines on the coronavirus outlook. The World Health Organization (WHO) overnight described the outbreak as a pandemic. Italy, where deaths rose by nearly a third overnight, has shuttered all shops except supermarkets, food stores and pharmacies. Australia announced it would pump A$11 billion ($7 billion) in fiscal stimulus into its economy by June. On Wall Street, the longest-ever bull market for U.S. stocks ended overnight with the Dow Jones index sliding into bear market territory. [.N] The yen was a touch firmer at 104.47 per dollar.

5e72c1022f70650360b267fb	Euro up after ECB asset purchase programme but dollar retains advantage	TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro rose against the dollar and the pound on Thursday after the European Central Bank announced a 750 billion euro asset-purchase programme in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Sterling teetered near the lowest since at least 1985 against the greenback. The Australian dollar was pinned near a 17-year low, while the New Zealand dollar fell to an 11-year low as price dislocations and low liquidity in other financial markets sparks an investor exodus into cash. The ECB said the new programme, which targets public- and private-sector assets, will be conducted until the end of 2020. The ECB’s announcement is the latest in a series of steps by major central banks this week to offset the impact the coronavirus outbreak is having on the global economy and financial markets. Analysts say the euro’s gains could be short-lived because many investors are selling what they can to keep their money in dollars due to the unprecedented amount of uncertainty caused by the virus epidemic. “The euro is being bought because the ECB, which had previously seen as somewhat reluctant to move, has come out with something very bold,” said Takuya Kanda, general manager of the research department at Gaitame.com Research Institute in Tokyo. “However, unless the number of new virus cases starts to fall, no amount of central bank action may be enough. There is an extreme form of risk aversion right now which will support dollar buying in the end.” The euro rose 0.37% to $1.0953 early in Asia on Thursday. Against the pound, the euro rose 0.6% to 94.30 pence. The euro rose 0.22% to 1.0590 Swiss franc. Against the yen, the common currency gained 0.56% t 118.66. The ECB’s purchase scheme, which was announced at an emergency meeting late on Wednesday, came less than a week after policymakers launched fresh stimulus measures. The new asset-purchase programme will also include debt from Greece, which has so far been shut out of ECB bond purchases due to its low credit rating, the ECB said. The pound was last quoted at $1.1643. Sterling tumbled to $1.1450 on Wednesday, the lowest since at least 1985, as the rush into dollars left no currency unscathed. The New Zealand dollar hit an 11-year low of $0.5696 early in Asian trade. The Australian dollar bounced 0.5% $0.5794 in Asia from a 17-year reached on Wednesday as the Reserve Bank of Australia pumped a record A$12.7 billion into the banking system on Thursday. Against the yen, the greenback roe 0.2% to 108.32. Global markets have experienced months of turmoil as the coronavirus, which emerged in central China late last year, has now spread to more than 100 countries and claimed more than 8,000 lives. The heightened uncertainty around previously unknown virus, which has triggered emergency lockdowns and injections of cash unseen since World War Two, is causing investors to abandon traditional trading strategies in favour of selling what they can to keep their money in dollars.

5e7a1b7263edf762027e13ad	USD/JPY, EUR/JPY Daily Forecast - March 24, 2020	USD/JPY topped exactly at the 111.45/65 target this time, after we topped 10 pips above on the first run. Looks like dollar pairs are entering a sideways consolidation phase & therefore I think we want to switch to more of a scalping/range trading strategy to take advantage of these conditions. EUR/JPY edged higher with a bounce from 117.60/80 up through 118.75/85 AND strong resistance at 119.20/40. Reports will be updated at about lunchtime GMT if necessary. USD/JPY minor resistance at 110.65/70 but above here targets 111.05 then retests 111.45/65. A break higher targets strong resistance at the February high at 112.00/20. On a break higher look for 112.80/113.00. Best support at 110.00/109.80 today. Longs need stops below 109.60 for 109.30 then strong support at 109.15/05. If we continue lower look for 108.50/30. EUR/JPY 119.20/40 no longer working as resistance after so many tests. We topped at 119.85/95 but above here meets strong resistance again at 120.25/45. Shorts need stops above 120.75. A break higher targets 120.95/121.05 & 121.35/45. First support at 118.90/70 but below here targets 118.35/25 & 117.60/80. Further losses test support at 117.25/15. Below 116.90 risks a retest of March lows at 116.30/10 so a break below is a range breakout & therefore a sell signal.

5e5d092cbd5d9d5ac072765f	USD/MXN Outlook: Rate-Cut Highlights Mexican Peso Carry Trade Value	The Mexican Peso has once again managed to regain the upper hand against the US Dollar in this week’s market showdown. Risk-off sentiment dissipated slightly, and equity markets reached all-time highs throughout the week as demand for growth-correlated assets increased. And no stranger to this risk-driven surge in markets was the Mexican Peso, which has continued to appreciate since the beginning of December 2019, gaining 5.4% against the US Dollar alone. And there is no real reason as of now as to why the coin would flip, causing a shift in demand towards the Dollar, unless there is a new round of generalized risk-off sentiment, given that the carry trade in this currency pair remains in favour of the Peso. As mentioned previously, the economic data in Mexico has not been outstanding as of recent, but we have seen a mild improvement in jobs data and an uptick in inflation. In its previous meeting, Mexico’s Central Bank (Banxico) had warned that there were still persistent risks to underlying inflation and economic growth, causing markets to believe a 25-bps cut would follow. And indeed, it did, as the central bank decided to cut the main interest rate by 25-bps to 7% on Thursday afternoon. In their report they noted that economic conditions remained challenging worldwide, which had prompted many central banks to adopt a low interest rate and accommodative monetary policy as a response to weakening growth. This has kept domestic growth stagnant in the last few quarters, prompting a downward revision in growth for 2020 and an accommodative monetary policy in response. Inflation has notoriously been an issue in Mexico, reaching levels above 6% in 2018, and resolving it is not as easy as adjusting interest rates, given the issue is based on structural problems in its economy. So Banxico is left in a tricky situation trying to balance stimulating economic growth whilst controlling inflation, given that the latest reading came in at 3.24%, above it’s target rate of 3%. This is likely the reason why rate cuts have been kept at 25-bps and spread throughout various months, even though a 50-bps cut would have been justified at the previous meeting. We can see from the daily USD/MXN that price action has remained on the downside this week, avoiding the upward reversal in the latter part which we have seen in previous weeks, which reinforces the Peso’s dominance over the Dollar. Its price has now fully entered the support zone we’ve highlighted in the past, so we can expect USD/MXN to tend towards its lower bound at 18.49, eyeing August 2018 lows at 18.40. Moving averages are now placed in descending order above the price, which shows that momentum in the downward trend is still high. The 50-day SMA continues to track the upper bound of the descending trendline, so an upward reversal may see initial resistance at 18.81, before heading higher towards the 19.00 handle. As with last week, price action will follow the path of least resistance, which at this point continues to be lower. A resurgence in risk-off sentiment would see an upward correction come in to play, but the effect will probably be short-lived. --- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Junior Analyst Follow Daniela on Twitter @HathornSabin	MXN
5e5d08ca73d82f5acc8afc91	Alibaba Q4 Earnings Preview	Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) reports its Q4 earnings tomorrow morning before the bell, and no matter how you look at it, the fourth quarter was a big one for the company. In the last three months of the year, Alibaba raised $13B in a secondary listing in Hong Kong, closed at a fresh record high above $210, and set a new record with $38.4B in sales on Singles Day alone. For Americans tracking at home, that’s more than US consumers spent online on Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Amazon Prime Day…combined! In other words, the company’s outlook was looking bright in Q4, and the market has set correspondingly high expectations heading into tomorrow’s earnings release. According to FactSet, analysts are expecting BABA to report $2.27 in EPS (up from $1.82 in Q4 last year) on $22.7B in revenue (up from $17.5B last year). 54 of the 56 analysts tracked by FactSet have “buy” ratings on the stock, with the other two analysts maintaining “hold” ratings, and an overall price target of $242 over the next 12 months. While the outlook through Q4 was undoubtedly bright, the biggest question on traders’ minds will be around how the outbreak of coronavirus has impacted consumer demand in China. This information will not be in the backward-looking reported figures, but management’s guidance for the year will give insight into the expected scale of the disruption to consumer demand, manufacturing production, and labor delivery. In other words, the company’s outlook moving forward will be the biggest driver for the stock. Technically speaking, BABA remains in a clear uptrend, recovering relatively quickly from the nearly 15% late-January swoon to trade back above $220. A strong report, with solid guidance for the year ahead, would likely take the stock to fresh record highs above $231; this would mirror the recent earnings-driven breakouts in massive US technology names like Amazon and Microsoft. On the other hand, a disappointing earnings report and acknowledgement that coronavirus is likely to lead to major disruptions throughout the year could take the stock back down toward the psychologically-significant $200 level, which has served as both resistance and support in recent months.

5e9547e00168790e8ecc8b60	Asian stocks register mild gains during full markets	With the hopes that coronavirus (COVID-19) is near to the peak gaining momentum, Asian shares register mild gains ahead of the European session on Tuesday. Other than the likely peak of the pandemic at global hotspots, US President Donald Trump’s push for the economic restart as well as upbeat prints of China trade numbers, for March, also pleased the share buyers. As a result, MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rises more than 1.0% whereas Japan’s NIKKEI surge above 2.50% by the press time. Australia’s ASX200 and New Zealand’s NZX50 also cheered China data and risk reset, together with the Chinese stocks, while also paying a little heed to the global rating giant S&P’s warning for the Aussie credit rating. Markets in India are closed but the government has announced the extension of earlier 21-day lockdown to May 03 with stricter measures to push the regulations. Wall Street posted a mixed outcome the previous day while the US stock futures are mildly in loss considering the preparations for the upcoming earning season. Further, the US 10-year treasury yields remain positive near 0.77%. It’s worth mentioning that the New York Fed earlier cited normalization in the markets by cutting off some report operations. Investors may now keep eyes on the virus updates while further news of the extended lockdowns may weigh on the risk-tone.	EQUITY
5e82acd357ae3167cb2eaac3	Dollar up, but yuan sluggish as traders sceptical of China PMI bounce	TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the yen on Tuesday as Japanese investors and companies rushed to cover a shortage of the U.S. currency before their fiscal year end, but sentiment remained fragile as the global coronavirus crisis showed no signs of abating. China’s yuan was little changed even after a key survey showed manufacturing returned to growth in March, as investors remain skeptical of the uptick given many businesses are still struggling resume full operations amid widespread disruptions caused by the coronavirus. The pound fell against the greenback and the euro as a sovereign ratings downgrade continued to weigh on sterling, underlining the strain on public finances from a much needed massive fiscal stimulus. Tuesday is the last trading data for Japan’s fiscal year and the end of the quarter for major investors elsewhere, which could lead to some volatile swings as big players in the currency market close their books. However, analysts warn that an almost certain global recession due to the coronavirus will remain a dominant influence in trading and eventually favor currencies least affected by the economic downturn. “The talk is Japanese names are short of dollars, which is likely to keep the dollar bid well into London time,” said Yukio Ishizuki, FX strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. “We have to look beyond that and focus on what’s going on in China’s economy. Even if there is some decent data from China, I cannot be optimistic, because economic activity in many countries is grinding to a halt.” The dollar rose 0.69% to 108.55 yen JPY=EBS on Tuesday in Asia. In the onshore market, the yuan CNY=CFXS held steady at 7.0977 against the dollar. China’s official manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index unexpectedly showed activity swung to expansion in March, but traders tempered their optimism because China’s economy is still expected to suffer a steep economic contraction in the first quarter and other major economies are also taking a big hit. Only on Monday the People’s Bank of China unexpectedly cut its reverse repo rate by the most in almost five years to relieve pressure on the economy. The euro EUR=EBS fell 0.24% to $1.1013. Traders are bracing for data expected to show a rise in German unemployment as the global economy reels from the coronavirus pandemic. Against the Swiss franc CHF=EBS, the dollar edged up to 0.9610, following a 0.8% gain on Monday. Sterling GBP=D3 fell 0.71% to $1.2331, and against the euro EURGBP=D3, the pound fell 0.5% to 89.34 pence. The pound remained under the gun after ratings agency Fitch cut Britain’s sovereign debt rating on Friday, saying debt levels would jump as it ramped up spending to offset a near shutdown of the economy. Traders are also awaiting the release of UK gross domestic product later on Tuesday. The New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 dipped after the country's government extended a nationwide state of emergency for another seven days to slow the spread of the coronavirus, but the kiwi quickly regained its composure to trade steady at $0.6029. The Australian dollar AUD=D3 held its ground at $0.6174. The antipodean currencies have come under heavy selling pressure over recent weeks as their close economic ties to China and the global commodities trade make them vulnerable to the coronavirus outbreak.

5e85940102de227524d97231	Zoom Video lurches from boom to backlash amid privacy issues, ‘Zoom bombing’ attacks	For weeks, Zoom Video Communications Inc. basked in the glow of a surging share price, enthusiastic research reports and insatiable demand among consumers and enterprises. In recent days, however, the one-time darling of Wall Street and Main Street has faced a backlash from regulators and politicians. Hackers have targeted the video-conferencing service because of its popularity, leading to a warning to consumers from the FBI about so-called “Zoom-Bombing” incidents. And a lawsuit filed Monday in California claims Zoom ZM, -6.24% allegedly gave users’ personal data to Facebook Inc. FB, -4.31% and other outside companies without fully informing customers. What a difference a week makes. Shares of Zoom toppled 6% on Wednesday, its third straight day of declines — tied for the longest such streak since late January. Since March 27, Zoom’s stock has tumbled 10%. Zoom’s rash of problems in some ways parallels those of Facebook: High-flying companies whose popular services have access to mountains of personal information that have made them both high-valued stocks as well as targets of lawmakers and scammers. See also: Zoom, Microsoft cloud usage are rocketing during coronavirus pandemic, new data show Ironically, the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have now both helped and hurt Zoom. “People who found the ease of Zoom as a new toy may change their opinion in 10 days when all this bad news sinks in,” John Durham, chief executive of Catalyst, a brand-strategy firm that works with tech companies, told MarketWatch in a phone interview. “And today, in this social-media climate, it’s harder to regain trust. Some Zoom customers might shift to known and trusted brands like Microsoft MSFT, -3.55% or Cisco Systems” CSCO, -2.51% for video-conferencing tools, he said. Thus far, Durham gives Zoom “mediocre to poor” marks for how it has handled events of the past week. Indeed, Zoom may find itself in the same position as Facebook, following the 2016 presidential election in particular. A slew of privacy- and data-related problems prompted the company to spend billions of dollars shoring up its security and regaining the trust of customers. “Two thoughts on the developments we have seen with #Zoom over the past couple of days,” Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies, tweeted. “It’s clear that changing perception takes much longer is much harder than making your tools Enterprise class. Just look at Google. Security & Privacy are not the same — Zoom must address both.” “Zoom was caught out in not thinking about some of the exploits people might be using,” Milanesi told MarketWatch in a message. Case in point: “Zoom Bombing,” in which a hacker essentially hijacks a video conference to post pornographic or hate images. There have been reports of trolls breaking into AA meetings and taunting recovering alcoholics, and of a virtual meeting of black students at the University of Texas being interrupted with racist slurs. The FBI’s Boston office on Monday advised users not to make Zoom meetings public or share links to the video conference on social media. “The millions of Americans now unexpectedly attending school, celebrating birthdays, seeking medical help, and sharing evening drinks with friends over Zoom during the coronavirus pandemic should not have to add privacy and cybersecurity fears to their ever-growing list of worries,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., wrote in a letter to Zoom CEO Eric Yuan on Tuesday. “Zoom has a troubling history of software design practices and security lapses that have posed significant risks to the privacy and safety of its users.” The data-sharing lawsuit, on the heels of New York Attorney General Letitia James’ look into Zoom’s security practices, underscores the myriad issues facing Zoom. And, like Facebook, it is attempting to respond quickly and minimize the damage to its brand. “Zoom takes user privacy, security, and trust extremely seriously,” a company spokesperson told MarketWatch in an email late Wednesday. “As more and new kinds of users start using Zoom during this time, Zoom has been proactively engaging to make sure they understand Zoom’s relevant policies, as well as the best ways to use the platform and protect their meetings.” Shortly after details over its data-sharing practices surfaced in a Vice Media report, Zoom officials acknowledged its data sharing in blog posts and said they had changed those practices. “Our customers’ privacy is incredibly important to us, and therefore we decided to remove the Facebook SDK [Software Development Kit] in our [Apple-based] client and have reconfigured the feature so that users will still be able to log in with Facebook via their browser,” Yuan said in a March 27 blog post. Separately, a Zoom spokesperson said company officials would fully comply with James’ request for specifics on how the company will safeguard users’ data. The AG’s inquiry came after a Consumer Reports investigation that found Zoom — while outlining in its privacy policy that it collects personal information about its users — failed to disclose details about how that information is used for advertising, marketing or other business purposes. “There is a huge shift in how we are using these tools,” Bill Fitzgerald, a Consumer Reports privacy researcher, told MarketWatch in a phone interview. “A month ago, most people had never heard of Zoom. They may have heard of Skype or Google GOOG, -4.91% GOOGL, -5.15% Hangouts. But shelter-in-place policies changed that.” Zoom has been among the biggest beneficiaries of the novel coronavirus outbreak, which has forced millions of Americans to work remotely. The company’s daily active users have catapulted 378% year-over-year, as of March 22, according to market researcher Apptopia. Gains had been most pronounced on Wall Street. While the S&P 500 index SPX, -4.41% has plunged 27% since its record high Feb. 19, Zoom stock has improved 32% since then because investors are betting Zoom will become a corporate and consumer staple after COVID-19 dissipates. Thestock rose nearly 115% in the first quarter. Despite spending hours running other people’s errands while risking their lives, gig economy workers rarely enjoy the full scope of protections and benefits often enjoyed by employees of other companies.

5e7dfe1c88ab0d4180f04f5c	Why “Return By Easter” Is An Economic Pipe Dream	March 27, 2020 Equities pull back Dollarfinds a bid Nikkei -3.88% Dax -2.11% UST 10-Year 0.771% Oil $22/bbl Gold $1622/oz BTCUSD $6640 Asia and EU No Data North America Open USD PCI 8:30 After a strong risk-on rally yesterday markets in Europe turned sour with index futures off by more than -2% in the morning dealing while the greenback strengthening again. European finance ministers failed to come up with a comprehensive pan- European plan to finance response to the coronavirus with Germans once again scuttling plans to issue mutually guaranteed bonds. This leaves ECB as the only pan-European institution to act for the union now and investors are understandably concerned that a monetary response will not be enough to create stimulus in the region. We’ll see if the pressure grows strong enough for Germany to finally cave in on a Pan-European fiscal plan but until such time the credit stress in the region will persist and dollar bid should stay in place. In North America today the markets will await the passage of the 2T stimulus bill by the House which looks to be a foregone conclusion by may provide a small bounce to equities. Meanwhile, the situation on the ground remains grim with the U.S. now having the largest amount of cases in the world with the New York tri-state region responsible for nearly half of all cases. The President floated the idea of a “partial” return to normalcy by Easter targeting policy directives by county level, but in truth, he does not have the power to force people back to work – that power lies with the Governors who are not likely to risk reinfection just for a few more days of expediency. Furthermore, even if the U.S. was to return back to a semi-normal state of operation the state most affected by the virus, the state with the least possibility of a quick rebound are also the states that are the most economically productive. Taken together, NY tristate, California, Illinois, Georgia, and Florida are responsible for more than 1/3rd of all US economic output and within those states, the counties that are most affected are the urban counties that are the most economically dominant. Therefore, any lift of the lockdown will have a much smaller economic impact than the market thinks and that, in turn, suggests that risk-off flows will resume	EUR
5e959c5a743482434cb06fd6	FOMC Minutes: Negative rates out of the question – UOB	Senior Economist at UOB Group Alvin Liew assessed the recent publication of the FOMC minutes. “The latest federal open market committee (FOMC) minutes revealed that the Fed pursued a ‘a forceful monetary policy response’ to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic by lowering the fed funds target rate (FFTR) by an unprecedented 100bps to 0.0-0.25% (global financial crisis (GFC) low), restarting quantitative easing (QE) and introducing various measures to ‘support the credit needs of households and businesses’.” “As for policy guidance, the Fed pledged to maintain rates at the low rate until the economy has weathered the recent events (COVID-19) and return on track to achieve the FOMC’s dual mandates of maximum employment and price stability. There was no discussion on the prospect of negative rates.” “The Fed has demonstrated it will do whatever it takes, beyond interest rate cuts and asset buying, to restore financial market stability, smooth out US dollar funding conditions and safe-guard the economy. That said, the Fed will do whatever it takes, except negative rates.”	USD
5e79a12fb1ea9835fa10caca	Japan finance minister Aso makes rare comment vs dollar's 'single-handed' rises	TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said the dollar’s single-handed rises against other currencies were likely driven by investors’ anxiety over the coronavirus outbreak, which has triggered an inflow of funds into dollars from riskier assets. “Everyone is buying dollars. That’s leading to declines in other currencies. Stocks and bond prices are both falling, which is something that has not happened before,” Aso told parliament. “It’s probably investors’ anxiety” over the pandemic, Aso said, in explaining what was behind investors’ hoarding of cash particularly in dollars.

5e67c6ef8977ab6a146703d6	Sterling drops as U.S. virus spending package talk boosts dollar	LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling fell on Tuesday, unwinding most of its gains notched up in the previous session, thanks to a broad dollar rebound on expectations that the White House will unveil a fiscal stimulus package to limit the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus. The greenback clawed back ground against a basket of currencies, including the pound, after a recent slump fuelled by coronavirus fears and a collapse in U.S. government bond yields amid a flight to safety by investors. President Donald Trump planned a news conference later on Tuesday after saying on Monday that he was prepared to take “major” steps to bolster the U.S. economy, boosting the dollar. British investors will have to wait until Wednesday to see the extent of their own government’s fiscal response to the virus outbreak, when new finance minister Rishi Sunak is expected to raise spending in his first budget. Sterling extended losses and was down 1.5% against the greenback at $1.2930 on Tuesday, after hitting a more than month-high of $1.32 the previous day. Analysts said the pound could face further selling pressure as markets expect the central bank to cut interest rates. “The downside pressure should be large today, targeting a correction,” said Karl Steiner, chief quantitative strategist at SEB, adding that it could soon trade at $1.2982. The pound edged up against the euro, up 0.29% at 87.05 pence per euro, but remained close to four-and-a-half month lows as concerns about ongoing fractious Brexit trade talks continue to weigh on the currency. Investors will be watching whether the Bank of England chooses to cut benchmark rates alongside the government’s budget tomorrow, after incoming Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey suggested there should be coordinated action. However, analysts at ING suggested that the BoE may feel it has to wait until its next meeting on March 26. “A rate cut linked to a budget may inevitably raise some questions surrounding independence – even if the circumstances may warrant it,” they said. Money markets are pricing in nearly two BoE rate cuts this month. Reporting by Iain Withers; Editing by Mark Heinrich	USD

Despite continued equity weakness, gold has lacked a similar follow-through after failing at resistance around $1,686 and may require consolidation before attempting another leg higher. How to Trade Gold: Top Gold Trading Strategies and Tips To be sure, the fundamental landscape remains tantalizingly uncertain which allows potential for a continuation higher to occur at any point but a slowdown in gains over the last few days and hint at weakness. Long upper wicks on recent daily candles suggest the same, but they are somewhat nullified by similarly long lower wicks – highlighting indecision. In turn, gold may look to consolidate and test support before resuming higher in the weeks to come. With that in mind, gold may look for initial assistance at $1,628.5 before subsequent support at $1,610 and $1,587 is required. Together, the levels should offer a bounty of support if prices continue lower. Over the longer term, however, prolonged uncertainty, loose monetary policy and the prospect of inflation as a result, may buoy gold prices. Consequently, gold may eventually look to retest the February 2013 swing-high around $1,686 which worked to stall the rally last week. If resistance at $1,686 can be surmounted, secondary resistance may reside at the Fibonacci line around $1,715. In between, the psychologically significant $1,700 could look to play a minor role. In the meantime, the risk-reward profile for bullish biases is not ideal, so waiting for a modest pullback may be prudent. Further, IG Client Sentiment data reveals retail traders are piling into the long-side, an indication XAU/USD may slip further before continuing higher. --Written by Peter Hanks, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com Contact and follow Peter on Twitter @PeterHanksFX	METAL
5e824f14c4225421ff7e7eaa	U.S. dollar gains as global easing gives temporary respite	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar advanced on Monday, snapping a week of declines, as investors braced for prolonged uncertainty and governments tightened lockdowns and launched monetary and fiscal measures to fight the coronavirus pandemic. China’s offshore yuan fell after the Chinese central bank cut a key interbank interest rate, while Singapore’s central bank aggressively eased monetary policy as well on Monday. The euro, sterling and Australian dollar were all lower, bringing an end to recent rebounds that followed the Federal Reserve’s efforts to calm the safe-haven rush to own the U.S. currency earlier this month. “You’re starting see other central banks being active, with Singapore, for instance, delivering an adjustment to its band,” said Edward Moya, senior market strategist at OANDA in New York. “All this follow-through easing around the world is providing a temporary dollar rebound.” Concern about the spreading coronavirus and the economic impact of shutdowns continued to dominate foreign exchange markets, but price moves on Monday were relatively well contained and much smaller than in recent sessions. “This speaks to the volatility of what’s going on,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist, at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York. “It means people are not making short-term convictions.” In afternoon trading, the dollar index rose 0.8% to 99.09. Analysts said investors’ end-of-month portfolio rebalancing as well as nervousness about the virus was also supporting the dollar. “The U.S. dollar remains strong relative to the beginning of the month, which further reduced the dollar value of bond and equity markets outside of the U.S.,” Barclays said in a research note on portfolio rebalancing at the end of the month. “However, the still historic fall in U.S. equity prices dominates and drives the model to produce strong USD buying signals across the board,” it added. The euro dropped 0.9% to $1.1037 . Sterling fell 0.9% $1.2366 . In the past two weeks, the dollar first posted its biggest weekly rise since the 2008 financial crisis as investors and companies rushed into the world’s most liquid currency, then saw its biggest weekly drop since 2009. Signs of funding stress have eased but not abated and hard-dollar cash remains in high demand. The safe-haven Japanese yen rose marginally, pushing the dollar down 0.1% to 107.88. Total global deaths from the virus are around 36,870 coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html and the United States has emerged as the latest epicenter, with more than 157,810 confirmed cases and 2,910 deaths. The dollar gained 0.4% versus the offshore Chinese yuan to 7.1132 after the People’s Bank of China unexpectedly cut a key interbank interest rate, the seven-day reverse repurchase rate, by 20 basis points. [nL4N2BN0QC] The Australian dollar dropped sharply before recovering to trade down 0.1% against the greenback at US$0.6158 .

Libya talks and the oil price While the German Chancellor Angela Merkel has managed to gather the biggest international players involved in the conflict in Libya in Berlin this weekend, including Russia’s President Putin and the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to discuss a resolution of the conflict in the country, back on the ground armed forces cut off a pipeline to the largest oil field in Libya.

5e9465d30b88e9755b823621	GBP/JPY trades with modest losses, below 135.00 mark	The GBP/JPY cross traded with a mild negative bias through the mid-European session, around the 134.75 region, albeit has managed to hold above daily swing lows. The cross failed to capitalize on its early uptick to levels just above the key 135.00 psychological mark, rather met with some fresh supply on the first day of a new trading week and moved away from four-week tops set last Thursday. A fresh wave of the global risk-aversion trade – amid persistent worries over the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic – provided a goodish lift to the Japanese yen's safe-haven demand and exerted some pressure. The market concerns resurfaced after China reported the highest number of new daily cases in nearly six weeks. This fueled fears about the second round of COVID-19 outbreak and dented investors' appetite for riskier assets. Meanwhile, the British pound retained its positive mood and remained well supported by the fact that the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson left the hospital on Sunday, one week after he was admitted for treatment of COVID-19. A goodish intraday pickup in demand for the sterling extended some support and assisted the cross to gain some positive traction during the early part of the European trading session, though lacked any strong bullish conviction. It will now be interesting to see if the cross can attract any dip-buying at lower levels or the current pullback marks the end of the recent strong recovery move from the 124.00 mark, or near 3-1/2 year lows set on March 18.

5e94f73074052b6b8ec3bc77	US President Trump: Strategy to slow the coronavirus spread is working	During his Coronavirus Task Force Briefings for Monday, early Tuesday in Asia, US President Donald Trump said that the numbers of daily infections remain flat and strategy to slow the spread is working. Also confirming the optimism was upbeat comments from the team member, Dr. Anothony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Number of daily new coronavirus infections remains flat. This is clear evidence that strategy to slow the spread is working. Fauci says even though we had a bad week last week, we're starting to see a few areas a flattening especially in hot spots like New York. Fauci says it's obvious that if mitigation had been started earlier, more lives would have been saved but if it was initiated later, more lives would have been lost. While the news should have ideally offered some pullback to market’s risk-tone, early Asia limits the reaction with a mild uptick in the US stock futures by the press time.	USD
5e5d092cbd5d9d5ac0727660	Gold Weekly Forecast: A Growing Case For a Range Break	As the official number of people infected with coronavirus grows unabated, US officials are now openly questioning these numbers and calling on China to become transparent over the outbreak. Larry Kudlow, the director of the US National Economic Council said recently that the US is disappointed with China’s response to the virus, adding that they were surprised that the numbers keep ‘jumping around’. As we stand, there are over 64,000 confirmed cases of the virus in China, 588 international cases and 1,383 fatalities. Coronavirus is now more deadly than the 2003 outbreak of SARS when there were 8,098 reported infections and 774 fatalities. There are also growing fears that the ongoing rally in the equity space – fed by central bank liquidity – are building up to a sharp correction, especially if the Chinese virus is seen to have made a significant dent in global economic activity. A sharp exit from risk-on assets - including equities – may well see the price of gold driven higher as investors look to get into safe-haven assets. On factor holding gold back from making fresh highs is the strength of the US dollar. The greenback currently trades at a four-month high and the inverse correlation between the two asset classes remains in place. The daily chart shows a bullish pennant formation, with resistance currently under threat. If this formation plays out, the $1,611/oz. recent high will come under pressure if horizontal resistance between $1,590/oz. and $1,592/oz. is broken and closed above.

5e95861195af934f6e832430	EUR/USD regains poise above 1.0900, looks to data, coronavirus	The single currency has resumed the upside on Tuesday and is now lifting EUR/USD back to the 1.0940/50 region, where some decent resistance has turned up. EUR/USD has reversed the pessimism seen at the beginning of the week and manages well to rebound from the boundaries of the 1.09 neighbourhood to the 1.0940/50 band during the European morning. In the meantime, the broader scenario in the global markets continues to look to the developments from the coronavirus for direction against the backdrop of the persistent lockdown in Europe and the US. Some countries, however, unveiled plans to start reactivating the dormant economy in the next couple of weeks, lending some support to the currency. Later in the session, there are no scheduled releases in Euroland, whereas Import/Export Prices, the NFIB index and speeches by FOMC’s Bullard, Evans and Bostic are all due across the pond. The euro is alternating gains with losses in the first half of the week, always with the COVID-19 in the focus of attention. On the more macro view, the single currency is expected to come under pressure in the next periods in light of the forecasted contraction in the economy of the region in the first half of the year, relegating hopes of a strong recovery to Q3 and/or Q4. On the positive side, the recent Eurogroup agreement helped to alleviate some political effervescence among some state members, keeping retracements in the currency as shallow for the time being. At the moment, the pair is gaining 0.26% at 1.0934 and a break above 1.0967 (weekly high Apr.13) would target 1.0971 (55-day SMA) en route to 1.0992 (monthly low Jan.29). On the other hand, immediate contention emerges at 1.0906 (weekly low Apr.13) followed by 1.0814 (78.6% Fibo of the 2017-2018 rally) and finally 1.0768 (monthly low Apr.6).	USD
5e667c17db7e142894bdf328	Should Traders Buy the Dip? That Depends on Policymakers	"""Widespread fear is your friend as an investor because it serves up bargain purchases."" ""Whether we're talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down."" ""We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful."" ""The best chance to deploy capital is when things are going down."" “A climate of fear is [investors’] best friend.” ""Opportunities come infrequently. When it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble."" ""Most people get interested in stocks when everyone else is. The time to get interested is when no one else is. You can't buy what is popular and do well."" Above is just a smattering of wisdom from arguably the world’s greatest investor, Warren Buffett, about buying stocks when they go “on sale.” Less august officials including economic advisor Larry Kudlow and even President Trump’s own son have similarly endorsed “buying the dip” amidst the current coronavirus-driven market swoon. That begs the question: Should traders be buying equities hand-over-fist here, or is this merely the start of a deeper drop? The answer, as ever, is complicated, and ironically, may depend heavily on actions from global policymakers like Kudlow himself. While rational minds can disagree about the extent to which COVID-19 will impact the health of the general public, the economic cost is becoming increasingly clear. For a global economy that was only expected to grow around 3% before coronavirus burst onto the scene, the risk of the global economy tipping into at least a brief recession is growing as individuals across the globe opt to take one less weekend trip or skip going out to the movies once a month. Of course, the biggest risk for the global economy is that falling spending begets more belt-tightening in a vicious circle that leads to a deep contraction in the global economy. In other words, this is exactly the time for policymakers to act. Unlike individuals and businesses, governments and central banks don’t have to optimize short-term cashflows or cut spending at the same time as others. In fact, such institutions can and should act in a completely counter-cyclical manner to stabilize markets and the economy. The answer to whether traders should “buy the dip” any time soon will depend on how well global policymakers do at that task over the next week or two. In terms of scheduled events, traders will be looking at the following releases to gauge the potential policy response: Wednesday, 11 March: UK budget release (rumors of coordination with the Bank of England) Thursday, 12 March: European Central Bank monetary policy meeting Wednesday, 18 March: Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting Of course, the speed of the market movements may provoke earlier interventions. This afternoon, President Trump will meet with his economic team to discuss fiscal stimulus measures to boost the economy, including expanding paid sick leave and deferring tax payments for some businesses. Meanwhile, we don’t have to look beyond last week to see an example of the Federal Reserve issuing an unscheduled interest rate cut; with markets pricing in an 80% chance of the Fed cutting interest rates all the way to 0% by the end of next week (!), we could see an announcement in that vein any moment: Source: CME FedWatch Make no mistake: the fundamental news around coronavirus is likely to get worse, day by day, for the foreseeable future as new outbreaks are discovered and more tests are administered. For now, fears of a “vicious cycle” of declining spending are keeping a lid on any bounces in major stock market indices. However, a strong, coordinated, reassuring response from global monetary and (especially) fiscal policymakers may be the sign traders need to see for equity markets to form a bottom even if the virus’s human cost continues to grow. In the current environment, bullish traders may remain on the sidelines until we see a convincing intervention from policymakers. Source: TradingView, GAIN Capital"	USD
5e5d0886bd5d9d5ac07275ba	As S&P 500 Crashes: What Can the Authorities Do to Stop the Bleeding?	The markets are under severe pressure this past week with the US equity market taking the charge in one of the worst slumps since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) back in 2008. The comparison is an apt one but also unfamiliar for many. Given how long ago the last official bear market took place, the full scope of the threat that we face may not resonate with many young investors. That has perhaps been somewhat evident in the reluctance in the past years to commit to a full deleveraging. The closest we cam was the 4Q 2018 tumble which barely missed the technical definition of a ‘bear market’ which is a 20 percent drop from peaks. We have already flipped from record high to technical ‘correction’ (10 percent drop) in the span of a week. Either the market will need to exhaust itself of external forces will need to step in with reassurance if there is reasonable expectation of a recovery. Focusing on the S&P 500 for a representative of ‘the market’ the pain is palpable. Though we are down seven trading sessions, the five-day rate of change encompasses the impact sufficiently. In a weekly comparison, this is the biggest slump since the 2008 tumble through September/October of that year – height of the crisis. This move has reversed 14 months of gain single-handedly while taking out the 200-day moving average and trendline support of the past year with nary a blink. Chart of S&P 500 with 5-Day Rate of Change (Daily) Chart Created on Tradingview Platform While the pace of decline is impressive, the consistency is itself worrisome. A seven consecutive day drop represents the remarkably timely reference to a similar trial of fear that prolific: the lead up to the 2016 presidential election. There are already parallels to that being drawn by President Trump himself. However, in such moves, there are natural ebbs and flows that occur in both mass psychology and the movement of money. Panic is a momentum built into deleveraging efforts to avoid more dramatic losses, but there is a segment of the market that will prove very resilient to short-term punishment and those that are interested in opportunistically entering at a point that they believe discounted against a backdrop where not much has changed. Should institutions (like the SNB), funds and other large bodies refuse to participate; the proportion of the market that is very responsive could settle enough to allow the opportunists to step back in. If that is the case, without further appetite for value, a pause would not bolster the case for a lasting recover well. Chart of S&P 500 and Consecutive Days Trends (Daily) Chart Created on Tradingview Platform When traders are looking for a reason to jump back into the fray despite such uncertainty holding firm, one of the more often cited sources of confidence this past decade has been a reference to the major central bank. These deep-pocketed groups have been very active in dumping liquidity into the system through rate cuts (some into negative territory) and introducing unorthodox support like quantities easing and repo activities. The Federal Reserve reverted back to the dovish side of neutral this past year with three rate cuts, but stated it intended to hold fast in 2020. The markets seem not to believe they will be able to hold out. Below is the difference in the implied rate of the February and December Fed Funds futures contracts which indicates the amount of easing expected over the next 10 months. The market is fully pricing in 75 basis point (three standard cuts). Chart of S&P 500 and Consecutive Days Trends (Daily) Chart Created on Tradingview Platform One of the greatest risks in my view is that the markets raise the stakes of dependency on the Fed and other major central banks only to learn that these groups have run out of effective options. The US central bank can cut a little further, but it is very near zero. Its European and Japanese counterparts are already below the water line. More stimulus hasn’t been effective for the Fed this year as it has lifted its balance with short-duration purchases. If confidence falters here, a lot of the foundation of appetite built up these past years could fall away and inadvertently exacerbate issues. Chart of S&P 500 and Aggregate Stimulus from Largest Central Banks (Monthly) Chart made by John Kicklighter with Data from Bloomberg Where the Federal Reserve and other monetary policy authorities are running short on coffers and effectiveness, the governments of the world still have the capacity to act. We have seen more than a few stimulus discussions across the globe and Japan even produced a sizable effort just a few months ago. Governments are not mandated to stabilize financial systems, but their interest in maintaining growth is clear. A problem is that in the past few years, policies have tended to defer to efforts that earn growth at the expense of trade (tariffs and such) which may benefit a specific economy but is a net negative for global growth on the balance. To respond to a global market slump, a collaborative effort would more likely be necessary and avoidance of further tariff-like efforts avoided at all costs. Google Search for Stimulus Chart from Google Trends With the US heading into a President election cycle there is clear interest from the incumbent White House to maintain stability at all costs. It can be difficult to win election within your own party or re-election if you are up for a second term if the economy and financial system are under severe pressure. The Great Financial Crisis saw the switch from Republican to Democrat president and we were just starting to see the hints of the Tech Boom-Bust in 2000 when George Bush replaced Bill Clinton. President Trump will be mindful of this risk and his administration will more likely reach compromises where previously they could not be found to help the campaign. Chart of S&P 500 and Election Year (Monthly) Already, the President seems to show appreciation for the risk and an effort to calm the market panic as fearmongering, but that has not soothed the financial system as of yet. The longer the selling persists, the more likely it is emerging policy efforts will be fast tracked.

5e861736699c5675f59b9bd1	This hard truth about the mortgage markets isn’t being told	Everyone wants to know what impact the coronavirus and the government response to it will have on housing markets. While it is too early to hazard a guess, some things are becoming increasingly clear. Already, it looks as if the U.S. is moving towards a temporary moratorium on mortgage payments. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac unveiled an emergency program which provides a two-month deferral of mortgage payments for any homeowner who claims to be facing a hardship because of the virus. The payments will be tacked on at the end of the mortgage term. The coronavirus rescue law just enacted by Congress includes a provision which requires all firms that service federally-backed mortgages to grant a forbearance of up to 360 days for any borrowers who say they have been harmed by the coronavirus outbreak. It is not much of a stretch to say that this virus has changed everything. Many of you may sense that the virus has undermined what you thought was still a fairly strong housing market around the country. In truth, the so-called housing recovery since 2010 has been little more than a carefully constructed illusion. The belief in a strong housing recovery was carefully devised using a strategy of misleading information, withheld data and false impressions. Read: These housing markets are in danger of a coronavirus-related recession As I have explained in recent columns, the strategy to turn around collapsing housing markets unfolded in three parts: (1) restrict the number of foreclosed properties placed on the market; (2) radically reduce the number of seriously delinquent homes actually foreclosed and repossessed, and (3) provide millions of delinquent homeowners a mortgage modification as an alternative to foreclosure. This strategy fooled nearly everyone into believing that the disaster has been overcome. With so few properties foreclosed and even fewer placed on the market, home prices had no where to go but up. The best example is Los Angeles County — ground zero for the collapse. In 2008, more than 37,000 properties were foreclosed. The plunge in foreclosures didn't really kick in until 2012 when the number dropped to slightly over 10,000. The next year, foreclosures plunged to 3,340. Don't think for a minute that this was due to an improving economy. Not at all. It was simply the strategy of desperate servicers. With so few properties foreclosed and even fewer placed on the market, home prices had no where to go but up. For years now, data providers, mortgage servicers and lenders have done their best to hide the real mortgage situation from the public. The largest data providers have never explained why the number of mortgages in their databases has shrunk so dramatically. For example, the largest banks serviced nearly 2/3 of all first liens in 2011 and their data was reported quarterly to their regulator — the Office of the Controller of the Currency (OCC). By 2019, that had plunged to less than 1/3. Read: Jumbo mortgages are haunting the housing market, and things could get really scary What had happened? The housing crash had left them with millions of seriously delinquent first liens to deal with. This was new territory for them and they were operationally not up to the task. As the cost of servicing delinquent mortgages soared, most of the largest banks decided to sharply cut back their servicing business. So they sold most underwater loans in their portfolios as well as the mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). The 2019 FDIC Quarterly reported that the large servicing banks sold off $500 billion in mortgage servicing rights to non-bank servicers in 2013 alone. This sale of MSRs has continued right through 2019 when $635 billion changed hands. Who bought these loans and the servicing rights remains largely a mystery. The consequences were far reaching. Whereas the large bank servicers had reported detailed data to the agency which regulated national banks — the OCC — the new non-bank servicers didn't really report to anyone. This has left an enormous hole in the reported mortgage data. In its June 2014 Mortgage Monitor, data provider Black Knight Financial Services reported that its coverage of non-agency securitized loans was slightly more than half of that universe. Hence, it extrapolated in order to estimate the entire non-agency market. In spite of having substantially fewer mortgages in its database obtained from the major bank servicers, Black Knight has never clarified or admitted how much its own mortgage database plunged since then. Another example of this coverage shrinkage is what had happened to HOPE NOW's report on mortgage modifications. In 2013, the HOPE NOW consortium included 18 major firms that serviced more than 30 million loans. By the third quarter of 2019, it had dwindled to only 12 firms which serviced a mere 18 million loans. Because of this, HOPE NOW's extrapolated modification numbers have become little more than a guess. Last October, MarketWatch published my column about the danger of mortgage modifications that re-defaulted. It did not include the data below, which shows truly scary re-default figures for non-agency RMBS loans. This graph was compiled by Amherst Securities Group — one of the best data providers at the time. It shows re-default rates as of July 2012 broken down by the year of modification. How many modifications were provided in just 2008-2010? HOPE NOW estimated that slightly under 4 million permanent modifications were completed in those three years alone. For 2008 and 2009, Amherst's graph showed re-defaults ranging from 75-90%. For the peak year of modifications — 2010 — it reported rates of 50-60%. Re-default rates for 2011 modifications were heading toward 40% over a period of less than two years. These extremely high re-default rates were not reported by any other data provider. Amherst's re-default figures do not include failed forbearances. Forbearances are arrangements whereby the lender agrees to temporarily defer mortgage payments while the borrower deals with an allegedly temporary financial problem. The suspended payments are usually pushed down the road and not canceled. At the end of the forbearance period, a repayment plan often begins with a higher monthly payment. HOPE NOW estimated that during the 2008-10 period, 3.4 million repayment plans had been initiated. Read: America’s housing market is showing the first signs of trouble from the coronavirus pandemic A more recent study on modification re-defaults was published in 2015 by two researchers at the Federal Reserve Board. Although they used a relatively small sample of roughly 50,000 first liens, the study showed re-default statistics in line with the earlier report by Amherst. The graph above shows the percentage of loans modified between 2008 and 2013 which were current and still being paid at the end of 2014. Those modified the earliest — between 2008 and 2010 — were current at rates of only 10% to 40%. This means they had re-defaulted at rates between 60% and nearly 90%. According to Attom Data’s important quarterly report on the average gross profit for home sellers, 2013 was the first year when sellers in many major metros began to see a profit on the sale of their house. It was no accident that the greatest gains in gross profit occurred in California metros where mortgage servicers had brought foreclosures almost to a complete halt. 2013 was also the year when the picture began to go dark on the non-agency securitized mortgage market. The very important quarterly report on non-agency mortgages put out by the American Securitization Forum ceased publication that year. The last comprehensive database which was a reliable source for the non-agency mortgage market was that of BlackBox Logic. Its entire database and analytic software was sold to Moody's in 2016. I have not found any Moody's report which made use of this important database. CoreLogic claims to have the largest non-agency securitized mortgage database of anyone. However, I have never seen any of their monthly foreclosure reports which made a connection between the rise in home prices and the orchestrated plunge in foreclosures. What can we infer from all this? First, the true condition of mortgage markets around the country is murkier than ever. Second, a full picture of mortgage modification re-defaults would offer us a much clearer understanding of how bad the delinquency situation really is. Third, data providers show no interest in giving us a more complete view, and finally, don't count on any help from the mortgage servicers.

5e681a4ed53f7f7b131418b2	Risk Returns, But Can It Hold?	March 9, 2020 Europe and Asia: North America: Risk rebounded with vengeance in Asian and early European trade today with U.S. futures rising by 4.5% as markets awaited a press conference from President Trump regarding U.S. fiscal measures to help combat the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak. In China meanwhile, the caseload rose just by 19 and some parts of the Hubei province which was the epicenter of the outbreak are starting to return to normal conditions. The Chinese have also announced that they have closed all the temporary hospitals built in order to treat the coronavirus patients as further sign that the virus is starting to recede. In Europe however, no such signs of a slowdown as Italy is now on full countrywide lockdown and cases in France and Germany inch above the 1000 mark. The bullish thesis is that by the end of March China should return to almost normal capacity, but no one can say if the resumption of social contact could trigger a second wave of infection in the country. Meanwhile, the virus is likely to linger on at least through April in Europe and North America and markets will be keenly watching the rate of new caseloads ex-China for any signs of the global slowdown. Against the general backdrop on consumer slowdown in G-3 economies, the markets are also grappling with the ongoing oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The Saudis have announced an output increase to 12.5 million barrels per day while Russia stated that it will ramp up output by 500bpd as the two vie to preserve market share in a price war. Oil was up today to $33/bbl on some short-covering flows but near multi-year lows and the great danger to the global energy sector is that this war of attrition will remain in place for quite some time triggering a series of bankruptcies in the industry that could have knock-on effects on the global financial system. Therefore markets will be very keen to see how the Trump Administration addresses all of the factors today and want to asses the policy proposals for both consumer relief and business bailout plans as the virus wreaks havoc with the basic day to day functions of the U.S. and the global economy. The rally in Asia and Europe has been driven by short-covering and bargain hunting flows but whether the bounce can hold will depend to a large extent on Trump’s message. If markets see little meaningful initiative on the fiscal front much of the day’s gains could evaporate once again.	EUR
5e7ca90172e80449f2c94408	Sterling extends gains as BoE promises further action if needed	LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling extended gains against the dollar on Thursday, as the Bank of England said it was prepared to take further action to limit the economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak and held benchmark rates at rock-bottom levels. The BoE, which made two emergency rate cuts and ramped up its bond-buying programme earlier this month, promised more asset purchases if needed to stop a coronavirus-related shutdown from plunging the country into a long recession. Separately, finance minister Rishi Sunak is expected later on Thursday to detail how he plans to support Britain’s 5 million self-employed workers through the crisis. The pound regained ground versus the greenback, briefly touching $1.20 before the BoE update for the first time since its sharp fall on March 18 to levels not seen since 1985. It was last up 0.5%, changing hands at $1.1932.. Against the euro it was flat at 91.60 pence per euro. The pound has been hammered in recent weeks amid panic in global markets and as investors scrambled for dollars - the world’s most liquid currency and one seen as a safe haven in times of crisis. A $2 trillion stimulus package agreed by U.S. politicians to shield the world’s biggest economy and co-ordinated action by central banks including the BoE to boost the supply of dollars have helped ease stress in money markets and some of the selling pressure on sterling. “Sterling will continue to trade mainly based on global market sentiment,” said Antje Praefcke, an analyst at Commerzbank. On Wednesday, the pound swung from $1.1971 to $1.1640 within a few hours, showing how volatile trading conditions remain. Implied sterling-dollar volatility is down from last week’s long term peaks but remains high, suggesting further big moves could be in store. “We have a strong combination of Brexit and coronavirus uncertainty that creates a difficult situation for the UK in comparison to the rest of the world,” Christophe Donay, head of asset allocation and macro research at Pictet Wealth Management, told a media call. “Relatively speaking the UK is in a tough situation. The current account deficit is high ...This is all not a great signal for sterling versus the other currencies.” Reporting by Iain Withers, Additional reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; ; editing by John Stonestreet and Gareth Jones	GBP
5e95642b181b8c1fd7f5a2a6	Europe to open higher as Chinese data boosts mood	Positivity from Asia overnight is spilling into Europe, with stocks opening on the front foot after the extended Easter weekend. Less gloomy than forecast Chinese trade data, in addition to more talk about exit strategies is lifting sentiment ahead of the start of the US earning season this afternoon. Chinese exports fell -6.6% year on year in March, whilst imports slipped 0.9% in the same period. Analyst had expected a 14% fall in exports and a 9.5% decline in imports owing to the hit from the coronavirus lock down. However, the better than forecast figures have lifted optimism that the economic damage is not as bad as initially feared. China’s first quarter GDP release will be closely watched on Friday, the broad expectation is that Q1 GDP contracted -6% versus 6% growth in the final quarter of 2019. Today sees the start of US earning season. US banks and economy bellwethers will be kicking off the season. According to FactSet earnings from S&P 500 firms are expected to contract -10.2%, compared to gains of 6.3% expected in January. Last week, following the dismal US initial jobless claims data, the US stock market still managed its best week of gains since 1974. Investors will be watching closely to see whether the bad news has already been priced into the share price. Pressure is growing on Angela Merkel to ease lock down measures and start to reopen the economy as the coronavirus daily death count drops to 176, putting the total at 2,799. The number of new cases was 2,2218, marking the fifth straight day of declines and the lowest increase this month. Angela Merkel, who has urged a cautious approach will give a videoconference tomorrow amid growing calls for a road map to normality. There is no high impacting data due today. German inflation data is due to be released on Thursday. Chinese GDP on Friday will also be closely watch for clues as to how hard the world’s second largest economy was hit in the quarter of its covid -19 lock down The Dax is set to open over 1% higher on Tuesday, as the index continues its recovery from its March 19th low. Immediate resistance can be seen at 10796 (overnight high futures), prior to 11040 (10th March high) and 11530 (8th March high) On the flip side support is seen at 10585 (trend line) prior to 10150 and 9335 (2nd April low).

5e5d08f4bd5d9d5ac0727601	Euro May Fall if IFO Data Shows COVID-19 Infecting Outlook	Asia-Pacific markets were met with a rude awakening as coronavirus fears soured risk appetite and sent the anti-risk Japanese Yen surging against the cycle-sensitive New Zealand Dollar and Norwegian Krone. S&P 500 futures dipped over one percent while gold prices gained on expectations that the impact from COVID-19 would bet met with stimulus from central banks and boost the demand for anti-fiat hedges. Data out of Germany carries a high market premium due to its ranking as the largest Eurozone economy and has been dubbed the “steam engine of Europe”. German business climate data for February is expected to register at 95.3 with the expectations component anticipated to show a 92.1 reading. However, growing concern about the coronavirus and Germany slipping into a recession may cause the data to underwhelm. Eurozone price growth prospects are looking gloomier by the day with the Euro 5Y5Y inflation swap forward – a favored inflation gauge of the ECB’s – hovering just above the all-time low at 1.1688. Regional economic data has also begun to underperform relative to economist’s expectations and could signal that analysts are overestimating the durability of the Eurozone economy in the face new fundamental forces. EUR/USD has recovered from the lower tier of the two-year support zone between 1.0783 and 1.0828 and may aim to challenge the December descending resistance channel. The pair may bounce back between the slope of depreciation and the floor at 1.0828 until the pair either capitulates or breaks higher.

5e876c27c753bc7ee29cdeed	Dollar gains on safe-haven bids; shrugs off horrible U.S. jobs number	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar firmed against major currencies for a third straight day on Friday, as investors took shelter in the U.S. currency amid worsening economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. “As we see poor data coming in from Europe, UK, Italy, if you’re trying to be rushing anywhere, it would be U.S. Treasuries and the U.S. dollar as a safe haven,” said John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading at Tempus Inc in Washington. The dollar largely shrugged off the U.S. non-farm payrolls report that showed massive job losses of 701,000 last month, compared with expectations of 100,000 lost jobs. March’s contraction abruptly ended a historic 113 straight months of employment growth. The Labor Department also revised February’s number upward to 275,000 job gains. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4% from 3.5% the previous month. “The plunge in non-farm payrolls in March, which is already close to the worst monthly declines during the global financial crisis, suggests the coronavirus pandemic started to decimate the economy even sooner than we thought,” said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. The non-farm payrolls report followed Thursday’s data showing initial claims for U.S. unemployment benefits rose to 6.65 million in the latest week from an unrevised 3.3 million the previous week. The figures far exceeded the median estimate of 3.50 million in a Reuters survey of economists. In midday trading, the U.S. dollar index was up 0.6% at 100.78 =USD. The index is on track for a 2.5% gain on the week, having whipsawed last month from highs on a scramble for cash before slumping as the U.S. Federal Reserve flooded the market with liquidity. The euro was down 0.6% against the dollar at $1.0787 EUR=EBS, on pace for a 3.1% weekly loss. Indecision among euro zone governments about a rescue package for the region’s hobbled economies has weakened the euro in recent days, helping the dollar to its best day in two weeks against the single currency on Thursday. Analysts said the euro may also be faltering due to rebalancing by forex reserve managers stocking up on dollars.The Japanese yen, Swiss franc, sterling and the Australian and New Zealand dollars all lost ground as the dollar strengthened across the board. JPY=EBS CHF=EBS GBP=D3 AUD=D3 NZD=D3. The dollar was last up 0.4% at 108.39 yen. As lockdowns continue, the economic impact of the epidemic is becoming more marked, with purchasing managers’ indexes across the euro zone and Britain on Friday showing a slump in business activity.

5e5d07f82e1fe5553d2b63bb	Geopolitics, FOMC Meeting Minutes and Canadian Inflation in Focus	It was a busier day on the economic calendar through the Asian session this morning. Key stats included October trade data out of Japan early in the session. Later in the morning, the PBoC also delivered its November loan prime rates decision. On the geopolitical risk front, a unanimous Senate vote on Tuesday in support of HK led to a warning of retaliation from China. With the chances of a phase 1 trade agreement hanging in the balance, the latest U.S move may add further pressure on Beijing to hold back. The trade deficit jumped from a ¥124.8bn deficit to a $17.3bn surplus in October. Economists had forecast a surplus of ¥301bn, however… According to figures released by the Ministry of Finance, The Japanese Yen moved from $108.478 to $108.457 upon the release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Japanese Yen was up by 0.10% to ¥108.43 against the U.S Dollar. The PBoC cut prime loan rates this morning. The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.68109 to $0.68169 on the decision. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was down by 0.18% to $0.6816. At the time of writing, the Kiwi Dollar was down by 0.19% to $0.6419. It’s yet another quiet day ahead on the economic calendar. German wholesale inflation figures for October are due out in the early part of the day. After a quiet start to the week, the EUR will be more sensitive to the numbers. Any moves, however, will likely be short-lived at best. Outside of the numbers, expect chatter from Beijing and the U.S and from the UK politics to also influence. While the EUR may prefer Britain to remain within the EU, an orderly departure is the next best thing… At the time of writing, the EUR was down by 0.05% to $1.1072. It’s another quiet day ahead on the data front. Key stats are limited to 3rd quarter labor productivity figures. Following disappointing claimant count and wage growth figures last week, today’s stats are unlikely to move the dial. UK politics is going to remain the key driver all the way through to 12th December. A pullback on Tuesday and early this morning came in response to Corbyn’s better than expected performance in the 1st leadership debate. At the time of writing, the Pound was down by 0.15% to $1.2907 It’s a quiet day on the economic calendar. There are no material stats due out of the U.S to provide the Greenback with direction. As the week progresses, updates from the U.S – China trade talks will have a greater influence on the Greenback. On the monetary policy front, the FOMC meeting minutes due out late in the day shouldn’t have a material impact on the Dollar. Powell’s testimony last week will have been considered more current, with economic indicators largely in line with the FED’s plan to hold. The Dollar Spot Index was up by 0.05% to 97.901 at the time of writing. It’s a busier day on the economic calendar. October inflation figures are due out of Canada later today. With stats having been on the lighter side at the start of the week, expect Loonie sensitivity to the numbers. A softening in inflationary pressure would raise the prospects of a BoC rate cut. The Loonie was down by 0.11% to C$1.3282, against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing.	USD
5e83fb15e25c606cfdb15664	Dollar gains for second day, shrugs off record US jobless claims	The dollar rose for a second straight day against a basket of currencies on Thursday as investors, worried about the prospect of a global recession, continued to take shelter in the greenback. “With the increase in the coronavirus impact around the world, investors are looking at the dollar as a safe haven,” said Chris Gaffney, president of World Markets, TIAA Bank in St. Louis, Missouri. U.S. jobless claims in the latest week soared to a record level, yet the dollar’s reaction was tepid at most. Data showed initial claims for unemployment benefits rose to 6.65 million in the latest week from an unrevised 3.3 million the previous week. The figures far exceeded the median estimate of 3.50 million in a Reuters survey of economists. “The order of magnitude of this data is so colossal compared to expectations that there’s really no datum to work out what the story is,” said Richard Benson, co-chief investment officer at Millennium Global Investments in London. “It’s just very, very bad. So I am not sure the market is going to trade on data surprises from that mix.” Markets have been alarmed since U.S. President Donald Trump’s warning on Tuesday of a painful two weeks ahead in fighting the coronavirus, even with strict social distancing measures. The United States has over 200,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases - the most worldwide - which has sent investors flocking to safe-haven assets. Some analysts do not expect the dollar to extend its recent rally after the Federal Reserve took a series of measures, which have begun to have an impact, to ensure an adequate global supply of the currency. The cost of raising U.S. dollar funds in the yen and euro swaps market stabilized on Thursday, with premiums favoring the other currencies, suggesting that greenback demand had receded from earlier in the coronavirus pandemic. In early afternoon trading, the dollar index was up 0.8% at 100.35 . Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.7% at 107.91 yen . The euro extended its decline, falling 1.2% to $1.0828, after hitting a one-week low . The Fed’s efforts to improve dollar liquidity have boosted other currencies such as the Norwegian crown, which advanced further on Thursday to a three-week high of 11.1820 against the euro. It was last trading up 2% at 11.24 . To combat the economic slowdown from the pandemic, the Fed said on Wednesday it was temporarily easing its leverage rules for large banks by exempting certain investments from a key leverage calculation.

5e78e7bf340e1e2fea1780cc	Zoom Video Communications (ZM): Opportunity Amidst a Crisis?	“The Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word 'crisis. ' One brush stroke stands for danger; the other for opportunity. In a crisis, be aware of the danger--but recognize the opportunity.” - US President John F. Kennedy So far, most investors have been caught up in the “danger” phase of the current global coronavirus pandemic crisis, with the vast majority of stocks falling in sync with the broader market. As traders (and the Western world more generally) acclimate to the “new normal” of sheltering in place to flatten the infection curve, they’re turning their attention to the investment opportunities offered by the crisis. With hundreds of millions, if not billions, of internet-enabled people laying low in their homes, video conferencing software offers the opportunity to stay in touch for both personal and professional reasons…and when it comes to video conferencing companies, no stock has caught investors’ attention more than Zoom Video Communications (ticker ZM – quick note not to confuse this with unaffiliated microcap Chinese-based ZOOM Technologies (ticker ZOOM) which surged 1000% last week in a textbook example of irrational investor behavior). Whether its digital businesses rapidly ramping up remote working capabilities, schools moving to online instruction, or friends just seeking to stay in touch through “virtual happy hours,” ZM has become the go-to provider for all video conferencing needs given its reputation for reliability and low-latency video. Perhaps most interestingly, to “zoom” has become a verb, like to “xerox” or “google” in eras past, entrenching it as a defining technology in the pandemic zeitgeist. To wit, the company’s app was downloaded by nearly 600,000 people…yesterday. From a financial standpoint, there’s certainly no way a traditional value investor like Warren Buffett will be buying the stock any time soon. As of writing, the company sports a $42B market capitalization and is trading up over 150% from last year’s IPO in the $60 range. The company is profitable (barely), reporting just $0.05 in diluted EPS last quarter, but it now trades at over 50x sales. In other words, much like Tesla (TSLA) or Beyond Meat (BYND) over the last year, ZM is the quintessential “story stock” that has captured investors’ attention amidst the current environment. With each of these stocks, there’s a compelling fundamental narrative, whether that’s the secular trend toward environmental awareness, healthier eating, the need to stay in touch amidst an unprecedented lockdown. Combined with the explosive rally in stock prices themselves, the narrative becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy for momentum traders looking to capitalize on the situation: Source: TradingView, GAIN Capital As with Tesla and Beyond Meat, there’s a long-term argument for a fundamental shift in favor of Zoom: even once the worst of the pandemic is behind us, many companies and individuals will be more comfortable using Zoom’s platform to conduct business and stay in touch with family and friends. However, at current prices, the stock is likely “priced for perfection” and may be vulnerable in the longer term as new competitors enter its fast-growing industry (once again, similar to the scenarios we’re seeing playing out with TSLA and BYND). For example, Microsoft, which offers enterprise video conferencing capabilities through its Teams platform, trades at just 8x revenue as of writing. Of course, long-term valuations are being thrown out the door in both directions as investors panic. From that perspective, ZM absolutely could extend its gains from here. Momentum traders may want to keep a close eye on short-term moving averages (such as the 8- and 21-day EMAs); as long as ZM remains above those indicators, the short-term momentum is in favor of the bulls looking through the danger and recognizing the opportunity.

5e78fe3992c4861bd2510cfd	S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 in Focus After Fed Launches QE-Infinity	Another weekly open and another announcement from the FOMC designed to, hopefully, arrest the global declines that have eviscerated pretty much every equity index on Earth, at least outside of China. In the US, both the Dow and S&P 500 passed the 30% marker last week, extending their respective slides into the weekly close as the idea of holding risk over the weekend just did not appear very appealing. That statement can be made on both sides of the matter, even for bears that have seen a precipitous decline over the past month as risk aversion has enveloped global markets. Weekend announcements out of the Fed are becoming a more normal thing; and each time the bank has increased the size and scope of the respective bazooka. Most recently, the Fed announced open-ended QE. This is on top of last weekend’s announcement for $500 billion in Treasuries and $200 billion in mortgage backed securities to be purchased, along with an emergency rate cut of 100 basis points. The one thing that’s clear is that the Fed isn’t going to stop employing stimulus measures in an effort to offset crisis-related moves from the continued growth of the novel coronavirus. The bigger question is if this will help to arrest the major sell-offs that have engulfed global markets over the past month; or whether some element of fiscal stimulus is going to be needed to help to turn the tides. In US equities, the severity of the sell-off has been in large part governed by the constituency of the index. In the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the hit has been harder than what’s shown in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100; as the Dow’s largest component of Boeing has been absolutely hammered over the past month, losing almost 70% of its value as the airplane manufacturer has been best by both the slowdown in airlines and the longer-running issue behind its 737 Max. The S&P 500 is now closing in on the 50% marker of the post-Financial Collapse move. This shows around the 2k psychological level, with the price of 2023 serving as the election night low for the S&P 500 when Donald Trump was elected as President of the United States. On a shorter-term basis, today’s low is holding around the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement of the 2016-2016 major move. Chart prepared by James Stanley; SPX500 on Tradingview The losses so far in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 have been tame by comparison. The index is currently holding above the 38.2% retracement of the post-Financial Collapse move; with a support assist coming in from a trendline projection that connects the February 2016 and December 2018 swing-lows. Also of interest to near-term price action – the 50% marker of the same 2016-2020 major move is helping to hold the lows whereas the S&P 500 is testing the 76.4% retracement of the move plotted over the same period. This could make the Nasdaq 100 as a more compelling option for those that are looking to fade this recent sell-off, looking for the troves of accommodation already provided by the Fed and, perhaps soon provided by Congress on the fiscal front to bring bulls back into the picture. Chart prepared by James Stanley; Nasdaq 100 on Tradingview The nastier of the three major American indices is the Dow, which is getting closer and closer to a test of the 50% marker of the move derived from the post-Financial Collapse backdrop. In the Dow – the big level of interest is around the 18k level. Last week saw the index drive below the 20k marker and, as yet, buyers haven’t been able to reverse the tide. The 18k level is notable as this helped to set resistance in November of 2014 and, in various ways, remained as such until July of 2016. This level even caught a re-test during the chaos of the Presidential election in 2016; with price action soon launching higher and never looking back – until February of 2020, that is. Chart prepared by James Stanley; Dow Jones on Tradingview Treasury Markets Still in Focus After Liquidity Concerns Show with Increased Volatility One of the more disconcerting aspects of this recent round of risk aversion is something that not very many folks are talking about, at least yet, and that’s the sharp volatility that’s been showing in US Treasuries even as the Fed is rushing to markets with accommodation. The past couple of weeks have seen outsized volatility in US Treasuries, with the 30-year Treasury bond spiking from a low of .84% on March 9th to a high of 1.94% last Wednesday. Matters have since calmed a bit, with the 30-year settling in at a current rate around 1.3%. Chart prepared by James Stanley; TYX on Tradingview The 10-year Treasury note has been on a similarly wild ride, spking down to an all-time-low of .4% just a few weeks ago; and then spiking up to 1.27% last Wednesday. Currently the 10-year is trading around the 75 basis point market, also illustrating a bit of calm after a major gasp of volatility showed in the prior couple of weeks.

5e5d07eb2e1fe5553d2b63a7	Updates on Trade and UK politics Remain the Main Area of Focus	It was a relatively busy day on the Asian economic calendar in the earlier hours of this morning. The Aussie Dollar was in action, with China inflation figures for November also in focus. On the geopolitical front, trade jitters lingered through the session, pinning back the Asian equity markets. House prices were on the rise in the 3rd quarter, with the House Price Index rising by 2.4%, quarter-on-quarter. In the 2nd quarter, house prices had fallen by 0.7%. Economists forecasted a 0.5% rise. According to the ABS, Business confidence deteriorated in November, however, with the NAB Business Confidence Index falling from 2 to 0. According to the NAB, The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.68235 to $0.68273 upon release of the figure. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was up by 0.06% to $0.6827. The annual rate of inflation came in at 4.5% in November, accelerating from 3.8% in October. Economists had forecast a rate of inflation of 4.5%. While consumer prices were on the rise, wholesale inflationary pressure failed to materialize, with wholesale prices declining by 1.4% in November. This was better than a forecasted 1.5% fall, however. In October, wholesale prices had fallen by 1.6%, year-on-year. The continued slide was reflective of conditions within the manufacturing sector. The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.68241 to $0.68271 upon release of the figures. At the time of writing, the Japanese Yen was down by 0.05% to ¥108.61 against the U.S Dollar, while the Kiwi Dollar up by 0.14% to $0.6558. It’s a relatively quiet day ahead on the economic calendar. Key stats are limited to Germany and the Eurozone’s business sentiment figures for December. While there’s little optimism across the manufacturing sector, we can expect the EUR to react to the numbers. 3rd quarter nonfarm payroll figures out of France will likely have a muted effect early on. On the geopolitical risk front, chatter on trade and opinion polls from the UK will continue to be in focus. At the time of writing, the EUR was up by 0.03% to $1.1067. It’s a particularly busy day on the data front. Key stats include October trade, figures, manufacturing, and industrial production figures and GDP numbers. We can expect the GDP and manufacturing production figures to have the greatest impact on the Pound. Late in the day, the BoE Financial Stability Review will also provide direction. While the stats will garner plenty of attention, ahead of next week’s Bank of England monetary policy decision, much will depend upon the outcome of Thursday’s General Election. Expect opinion polls and predictions to continue to influence. As we saw through the start of the week, the Pound got a boost off the back of the weekend opinion polls and YouGov’s opinion poll tracker. At the time of writing, the Pound was up by 0.03% to $1.3151. It’s a relatively quiet day on the economic calendar. Finalized 3rd quarter nonfarm productivity and unit labor costs are due out later today. We will expect the numbers to have a muted impact on the Greenback, with geopolitics in focus on the day. As the 15th December rapidly approaches, the markets will be looking for progress on talks and a delay to the rollout of fresh tariffs… At the time of writing, the Dollar Spot Index was down 0.02% at 97.627. It’s a quiet day on the economic calendar. There are no material stats due out of Canada to provide the Loonie with direction. The lack of stats will leave the Loonie in the hands of market risk appetite on the day. 15th December tariffs would be a negative for crude oil prices and the Loonie, making trade updates and crude oil inventories the key driver. The Loonie was up by 0.04% to C$1.3234, against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing.	AUD
5e93d8b3745d871f94fec3d3	Easter Monday Leaves COVID-19 in Focus, with no Economic Data to Influence	It was a quiet start to the week on the economic calendar, with no material stats to provide the markets with direction. The lack of stats will leave the global financial markets in the hands of the COVID-19 figures from the weekend. Geopolitical events around the world will also provide direction. News of Boris Johnson coming out of ICU and sentiment towards the EU’s €500bn stimulus package will likely get more consideration. Expect the same for the agreed 10m bpd oil production cut by the world’s oil producers. On the face of it, neither appear to be close to the quantum required. On Sunday, the total number of coronavirus cases across France, Germany, Italy, and Spain rose by 13,235 to 583,639. In the U.S, the total number of cases increased by 25,588 to 558,467. That took the total number of cases globally to 1,849,493. Key take away from the numbers was a marked decline in the new of new cases across the EU and the U.S. It is worth noting, however, that a similar trend was seen on the previous weekend, where new cases had seen a marked decline on Sunday. Monday and Tuesday’s numbers will, therefore, be key in the week ahead. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was down by 0.19% to $0.6337, with the Kiwi Dollar down by 0.12% to $0.6070. The Japanese Yen was up by 0.31% to ¥108.13 against the U.S Dollar Volumes were on the lighter side, with a number of key markets closed for Easter Monday. Its quiet day ahead on the economic calendar, with the major EU markets closed for Easter Monday. The lack of stats will leave the EUR in the hands of the coronavirus numbers and sentiment towards the latest EU stimulus package. Falling numbers will ultimately provide support to the EUR, though the size of the stimulus package is an issue. At the time of writing, the EUR was down by 0.09% at $1.0927. It’s also a quiet day ahead on the economic calendar, with the UK markets closed for Easter Monday. While there are no stats to consider, market reaction to news of British PM Johnson coming out of ICU should be positive for the Pound. A continued rise in the number of new cases and deaths, however, will test support as medical experts warn of a peak in the number of cases in a week or two. At the time of writing, the Pound was up by 0.09% to $1.2466. It’s a quiet day ahead on the U.S economic calendar, with no material stats to provide the Dollar with direction. With no stats to consider, expect the global coronavirus numbers to also provide direction… Market disappointment with the EU’s COVID-19 stimulus package could support a pickup in the Dollar early in the week. The Dollar Spot Index was up by 0.01% to 99.493 at the time of writing. The markets are also closed, leaving the Loonie free from the economic calendar. A lack of stats will leave the Loonie in the hands of the market reaction to the agreement amongst oil producers to cut output. With Mexico now on board, thanks to U.S President Trump’s intervention, the markets will need to assess whether it’s enough. Based on estimates of a slump of as much as 30m bpd in demand, more is going to be needed, particularly from the U.S. The Loonie was up by 0.03% at C$1.3952 against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing.

5e5d08f673d82f5acc8afcc5	Coronavirus, Weaker PPI hitting AUD/USD	Fears of an increase in the contagion of the coronavirus have been causing a selloff in the Australian Dollar across the board. As we have discussed during the US-China trade war, the Australian economy is directly tied to China’s economy. China is a large importer of Australian goods and services. Therefore, if China’s economy is to slow down because of the Coronavirus, the Australian economy may slow down as well. There have already been talks of the virus knocking off up to 2% off Q1 GDP for China. Businesses are temporarily shutting down. Airlines are halting flights to China for as long as 3 months (Delta Airlines just announced). All of this is causing a slowdown in China, and therefore, a potential slowdown in Australia. In addition, the latest inflation data is not helping. Earlier, Australia released the PPI data for Q4. The actual print was 0.3% vs 0.5% expected and 0.4% previous. Add bad economic data into the mix, and it’s a recipe for AUD/USD to trade lower into the weekend. Last week, we discussed how AUD/USD was at an inflection point ahead of Employment data. The headline data was better than expected, and it gave the pair a temporary bounce. As we had discussed last week, AUD/USD was at a confluence of support and resistance areas, including trendline, necklines, moving averages, and Fibonacci Retracement levels. However, as news of the Coronavirus began to spread, price broke lower, and quickly hit the target of the head and shoulders pattern near .6720. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com Price is currently closing in on recent lows from late summer near .6670, which are levels that haven’t been seen since 2009. If price breaks .6670, we must look for Fibonacci extensions for next possible support levels. .6582 is the 127.2% extension from the October 2nd low to the December 31st high. The next Fibonacci extension level is the 161.8% extension at .6460. Horizonal resistance above at .6750, and then the downward sloping trendline from back in June 2018 near .6800. The previous support zone (which now acts as resistance) from before the employment data begins at .6825. Source: Tradingview, FOREX.com The fear of the virus spreading is real. The low PPI data earlier is real. The actuality of it spreading, or slowing down of the Chinese economy, may or may not be as real. We have data to determine whether fundamentals and technicals are getting better or worse. We don’t have as much data for the coronavirus. Continue to watch the rate at which the virus is spreading, the number of multi nationals temporarily shutting down operations in China, and these key markets. This will help to put the severity of the issue into better context.	AUD
5e959d971249514916b80e99	Gold hits a new 8-year high	XAU/USD traded higher yesterday, breaking above the peak of March 9th, at 1704, that way reaching a new 8-year high. The precious metal has been printing higher highs and higher lows above an upside support line taken from the low of March 19th, while since April 2nd, it’s been trading above all three of our moving averages on the 4-hour chart. In our view, these technical signs paint a positive near-term picture. If the bulls are willing to stay in the driver’s seat, we would expect them to climb towards the 1755 territory, defined as a resistance by the highest point of November 2012. If they are strong enough to overcome that obstacle as well, then we may see them putting the 1795 zone on their radars. That zone marks the peak of September 2012. Shifting attention to our short-term oscillators, we see that the RSI, already above 70, hit support near that mark and turned up again. The MACD lies above both its zero and trigger lines, but currently points sideways. Both indicators detect upside momentum but the flattening of the MACD makes us careful with regards to a possible pullback soon, perhaps after the price challenges the 1755 area. In order to start examining the case of a trend reversal though, we would like to wait for a decisive dip below the 1672 barrier, defined as a support by the inside swing highs of March 11th and April 7th. Such a move could initially open the path towards the low of April 8th, at around 1641, the break of which could carry more bearish implications, perhaps setting the stage for the 1605 hurdle, marked by the low of April 3rd.

5e81b594c496d2354de72fd3	US Close – G20 Optimism, Oil, Gold, Bitcoin	After a few days of modest declines, US stocks are higher as trade optimism is starting to get priced in for this weekend’s events at the G20 summit in Japan. The US- China trade war has dragged on for over a year and it seems both sides are politically motivated to wrap up a final agreement by the Fall. Ahead of the highly anticipated Saturday meeting between Trump and Xi, both sides are trying to downplay expectations. Markets should start to expect Trump to offer some concessions regarding Huawei and to delay of the next round of tariffs on additional $300 billion worth of Chinese imports. In return, Trump is expecting Beijing to show some purchases, structural changes, changes IP law and market access. Talks fell apart last month when China balked at changing their law, this should not be an issue as what Xi agrees upon will have the full support of the Chinese government. This appears to be a critical juncture for both sides and we should some red lines moved on both sides. If they can’t iron out any concessions this weekend, markets will be in for a rude awakening. Oil Crude prices are getting pulled in every direction ahead of a couple key meetings at this weekend’s G20 summit in Osaka. Investors want to know if Trump and Xi can revive trade talks and if President Putin will signal to Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed Bin Salman that Russia will stay in the OPEC + production cut deal. Expectations going into the weekend are looking cautiously optimistic for oil higher prices. While some of the rhetoric on Chinese demands on Huawei and Trump’s unpredictability have many skeptical that trade talks will blow up, both sides have political motivations to wrap up a trade deal by the fall and that would require a resumption of a constructive dialogue. Russia is likely to play ball as they seek to secure further investment and trade deals with the Saudis. Gold Gold continues to come off the six-year high made earlier in the week as markets await to see if President Trump and his Chinese counterpart will resume constructive trade talks with the hopes of identify a timeline to secure a final deal. Today, both sides delivered some posturing, but the base case remains China and US will agree on fresh trade truce with both sides delivering some modest concessions to keep talks going. Any constructive pact reached over the weekend will be met with skepticism that we will see a prolonged battle that will continue to damage sentiment globally. Gold should be supported on risks that this next round of trade negotiations can blow up any point even after we see a reset of talks. Softer global growth and additional stimulus from the larger central banks should also provide the yellow metal with support. Bitcoin The cryptocurrency world was once again reminded of the violent swings we can see with Bitcoin. After a meteoric rise over the past two-weeks, the digital currency sold off as short positions approached record territory and after Coinbase’s brief outage. Further downward pressure could see the psychological $10,000 level targeted. The bull case still remains intact, but we could see investors become skeptical about jumping back into Bitcoin volatility slows down. This article is for general information purposes only.

5e737359e64773624b6a0ffc	GBP/JPY Rebounds, But Stays In A Downtrend	GBP/JPY traded higher today, after hitting support at 124.00 yesterday. Overall, the price structure remains of lower highs and lower lows below the downtrend line drawn from the high of February 26th, and thus, even if the recovery continues for a while more, as long as the rate stays below that line, we would consider the near-term outlook to be negative. As we already noted, the rebound may continue for a while more and perhaps challenge the 128.80 zone, marked by the inside swing lows of Monday and Tuesday. The bears could take charge from near that area and perhaps dive for another test at the 124.00 hurdle. If they don’t stop there this time around, we could see them aiming for the “flash crash” low of October 7th, 2016, the break of which may extend the slide towards the low of July 26th, 2012, at around 120.80. Looking at our short-term oscillators, we see that the RSI has rebounded and just exited its below-30 zone, while the MACD, although below both its zero and trigger lines, shows signs of bottoming as well. These indicators suggest that the downside momentum is slowing, which corroborates our view for some further recovery before the bears take the reins again. In order to start examining the case of a trend reversal, we would like to see a clear break above 131.30, a resistance marked by Tuesday’s high. Such a break may also drive the rate above the downtrend line and could initially aim for the 134.20 obstacle, defined as a resistance by the high of March 13th. Another break, above 134.20, could pave the way towards the pea of March 10th, at around 137.20.	JPY
5e5d08f673d82f5acc8afcbc	Corona panic selloff settles; FTSE trades higher	Corona panic selloff settles, FTSE trades higher The panicked corona-triggered selloff in Chinese stock markets seems to have run its course for the moment and today both the Shanghai and the Shenzhen indexes closed higher, providing a chance for European markets to catch their breath. The FTSE gained over 1.5% after opening, lifted by NMC Health and stocks with heavy exposure to Chinese markets including miners and luxury goods firms. Two top company news items this morning came from plumbing supplier Ferguson which announced a large share buyback programme and plans to list in the US, and BP, which announced a forth quarter loss. Investors welcomed Ferguson’s decision to spin off its UK business Wolseley and shares gained nearly 5.5% on the news. BP rallied 3.5% once investors did all the maths on the company’s latest earnings because although the company’s earnings were lower than in 2018 due to lower oil prices, its replacement cost profit excluding one-off items was still $2.57 billion, significantly higher than the consensus analyst forecast. Oil firms, pound lethargic Oil markets also showed some improvement after China’s central bank stepped in to protect the economy from the effects of the coronavirus. Brent crude recovered from a low of $54 touched late Monday to trade up 1.2% higher this morning. WTI briefly broke below the $50 mark but at that level started to look oversold and is now trading above $51. Sterling trade has been fairly lethargic this morning with both pound/dollar and pound/euro trading in a very narrow channel around the flat line.	GBP
5e6bde4489f9a743bf5ce6a1	OIL MARKET WEEK AHEAD: And You Thought it Couldn’t Get Worse!	Coronavirus is just getting its claws into Europe and is in the early stages of spreading in the US, so the week ahead will inevitably bring more disruptions on both sides of the Atlantic, from public events via trading to travel. Travel faces more disruptions The shock decision to suspend flights between Europe and the US is about to take a heavy toll on the airline operators, but it could be just a warm up for what is to come now that Spain has declared a state of emergency because of the spread of COVID-19. The number of coronavirus cases in Spain is currently rising the fastest in Europe, up over 1,100 in the last 24 hours, and the country has started locking down regions that have been the worst affected. At the time of writing, flights in and out of the country were still running normally but it is far from certain that this will be the case next week. The fallout of the suspensions is beginning to show. Norwegian Air is cancelling 4,000 flights until the end of May and cutting 50% of its staff; other airlines are likely to follow suit, particularly budget airlines operating on a very thin margin. Coronavirus is also beginning to spread much faster in the Scandinavian countries and in Switzerland. In the week ahead, look for land transport across Europe to become affected as countries start bringing in more Italy-type restrictions that make any non-essential travel very difficult. US weekly oil stocks In the US, governors of five US states have declared a state of emergency and although there have not yet been any restrictions on travel across the country, nor does a state of emergency imply that travel will stop, travel in and out of the more heavily affected towns and areas is beginning to ebb. Transport, be it cars, buses or planes, makes a total of almost 70% of the US crude oil demand and the slowdown in travel which will inevitably happen over the coming weeks will erode the already slightly weaker demand. Look out for EIA’s weekly petroleum market update due on Wednesday, particularly after the last update showed a far higher increase in US crude supplies than expected. They rose to 7.7m bbl against expectations of an increase of just 2.5m bbl. Who will increase oil production in April? There is no longer a simple answer to that question because reality has surpassed some of the scenarios major oil producers have based their production plans on at the start of March. Yes, Saudi Arabia did say it will pump more oil and sell more oil to Asia from April, and yes, Russia did say that it could increase oil production by 200,000 barrels per day and yes, US shale producers had every intention of continuing to expand their output this spring. However, faced with the speedy decline in demand and a massive plunge in prices, reality might turn out completely different. There is already evidence that a number of US shale producers are struggling to remain financially afloat, and they may not survive lower demand from drivers and the airline industry which is likely to last into May. Also, at current oil prices both Saudi Arabia and Russia will struggle to balance out their budgets so it will be a question of who can handle losses the longest.

5e5d090dbd5d9d5ac072762f	Canadian Dollar Price Outlook: Loonie Presses USD/CAD Towards Support	The Canadian Dollar is on the counteroffensive against the US Dollar after reversing off key resistance last week with USD/CAD falling more than 0.8% off the monthly highs. While the near-term risk remains weighted to the downside, the decline is now approaching broader uptrend support and we’re looking for a reaction just lower. These are the updated targets and invalidation levels that matter on the USD/CAD price charts. Review my latest Weekly Strategy Webinar for an in-depth breakdown of this Loonie trade setup and more. Chart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Technical Strategist; USD/CAD on Tradingview Technical Outlook: In my last Canadian Dollar Price Outlook we noted that the USD/CAD rally was, “now eyeing confluence resistance at 1.3330/36- a region defined by the September high-day close at and the 61.8% retracement of the May decline. The focus is on a reaction off this threshold with the immediate long-bias vulnerable while below.” Price registered a high at 1.3329 last week before reversing with the sell-off now attempting to break below monthly open support at 1.3236- a close below this threshold exposes confluence support at the 38.2% retracement / 100% extension at 1.3174/85; looking for a reaction there IF reached. Notes: A closer look at Loonie price action sees USD/CAD continuing to trade within the confines of a descending pitchfork formation extending off February highs with price testing fresh monthly lows today in New York trade. Initial support rests with the lower parallel, currently ~1.3210s with a break below 1.3174/85 ultimately needed to suggest a larger reversal is underway targeting subsequent support objectives at 1.3141 and 1.3096-1.3102. Weekly open resistance stands at 1.3245 with near-term bearish invalidation set to the weekly opening-range highs at 1.3278. Bottom line: USD/CAD is attempting to break monthly opening-range and leaves the risk lower for now while within this formation. From a trading standpoint, look to reduce short-exposure / lower protective stops on a test of key support / the lower parallel – an area of interest for possible downside exhaustion.

5e81b5b6c496d2354de72fe5	Dollar direction to be dictated by week’s events	Monday June 3: Five things the markets are talking about Global stocks are under pressure along with bond yields in the first session of a new month, as investors continue to digest the impact of President Trump’s threat to introduce fresh tariffs on imports from Mexico. The market has grown nervous about the prospects for global growth in recent sessions as concerns about trade tensions returned to the fore. U.S Ten-year Treasury yields (+2.08%) have fallen to the lowest in almost two-years with more downside expected to come, while crude oil has extended its rout from May, a month in which saw West Texas Intermediate (WTI) tumbled -16% amid concern over global demand. In FX, the yen (¥108.26) has managed to hold onto most of its late gains from last week. President Trump’s tariff moves against Mexico late Thursday has produced a wave of forecast revisions by the street. Fixed income dealers are now pricing in a -50 to- 75 bps cut in rates by the U.S Fed in H2, as rising trade tensions drag on global growth. Expect investors to look to today’s data on U.S manufacturing and this week’s non-farm payroll (NFP) report on Friday for clues on how trade concerns are affecting the domestic economy. On Tuesday, Europe’s statistics agency will provide fresh estimates on employment and inflation in the region. On the central bank front, the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) call on Tuesday (12:30 am ET) is too close to call with a rate cut a possibility. On Thursday the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may well cut rates, while the European Central Bank (ECB), no action is expected (07:45 am ET). Yet the ECB’s reaction to Brexit risk and the Sino-U.S trade war may yet put a greater “dovish” tilt to their statement. In Germany, markets have drifted lower after the chairwoman of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s junior coalition partner stepped down, adding to uncertainty over the government in Berlin. On tap: USD ISM Manufacturing PMI & AUD retail sales (Jun 3), RBA monetary policy statement & AUD GDP (Jun 4), ECB monetary policy statement & press conference, CAD trade balance & CNY Bank Holiday (Jun 6), CAD & U.S employment data (Jun 7). 1. Stocks suffer due to tariff fears In Japan, stocks plummeted overnight as investors worried about the rising risks to global and domestic growth from a widening tariff war between the U.S and its major trading partners. The Nikkei share average ended -0.9% lower, the weakest closing level since early February. The broader Topix also dropped -0.9%. Note: The index-heavy SoftBank Group Corp tumbled -6.2% after the Wall Street reported that the company’s bid to raise a second mega fund has met with “cool reception from some of the world’s biggest money managers.” Down-under, Aussie stocks slump on U.S trade tensions with China and Mexico. The S&P/ASX 200 index closed -1.2% lower overnight, reflecting the markets worries that Trump’s aggressive trade diplomacy towards China and Mexico could tip the U.S and other major economies into recession. In S. Korea, the Kospi index rallied +1.4% as the KRW’s bounce-back eased concerns about possible capital flight, and as investors hunted for bargains on perception that blue chips have been oversold. In China and Hong Kong, stocks have started a new month on a ‘bearish’ note on concerns that escalating trade tensions could increase risks of a global slowdown. The CSI300 index dipped -0.2%, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost -0.3%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dropped -0.1%, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index gained +0.1%. In Europe, regional bourses trade lower amid trade tensions again weighing after various weekend comments from both China and U.S. In the U.K, the FTSE is underperforming following a weaker than expected PMI release (see below). U.S stocks are set to open in the ‘red’ (-0.53%). Indices: Stoxx600 -0.59% at 366.90, FTSE -0.76% at 7,107.04, DAX -0.51% at 11,666.80, CAC-40 -0.64% at 5,174.51, IBEX-35 -0.62% at 8,948.00, FTSE MIB -0.55% at 19,692.50, SMI -0.44% at 9,481.80, S&P 500 Futures -0.53% 2. Oil prices plunge further on trade war fears Oil prices plunged again, extending last week’s heavy losses as deepening U.S trade wars fanned fears of a global economic slowdown. Front-month Brent crude futures are at +$60.96, down -$1.03 or -1.7% below Friday’s close. U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures are at +$52.98 per barrel, down -52c, or -1%. Note: Prices had dropped by more than -3% on Friday, with May recording the biggest monthly loss in six-months. OPEC+ continues to give assurances that they would continue to manage global crude supplies to avoid a surplus. Global markets have reeled in recent weeks over concerns that the global economy could stall amid rising trade tensions between the U.S and China. Fears over trade have been further stoked now that President Trump has announced punitive tariffs against Mexico – a key oil supplier to the U.S. Note: Brent crude oil prices have dropped almost -20% from their 2018 peak as global supplies tightened due to output curbs by OPEC+, as well as a drop in Iranian exports due to U.S sanctions and Venezuelan production. Data overnight showed that Saudi Arabia pumped +9.65M bpd, cutting deeper than its production target under a global pact to reduce oil supply – the Saudi’s output target under the OPEC+ led pact is +10.3M bpd. Ahead of the U.S market, gold prices trade atop of their six-month high print as fears of a global economic slowdown support the safe-haven demand for bullion, with a weaker dollar adding further support. Spot gold is up +0.3% at +$1,288.49 an ounce, having touched its highest since June 15 at +$1,292.32 late last week. U.S gold futures are up +0.5% at+$1,290.40. 3. Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is set for its first cut since 2016 Down-under, in the last month, Australia has witnessed a surprise federal election result, a further uptick in the unemployment rate (along with an uptick in participation and under-employment) and a speech from Governor Lowe, which has many pricing in the first rate cut since August 2016. However, with a slam-dunk rate cut priced in, expect investor focus to fixate on the banks forward guidance. Potential outcomes: Base case: A -25 bps cut with a nod to at least one further cut (possibly in Lowe’s evening speech). Dovish case: Any suggestions that easing above and beyond the previous assumed -50 bps of cuts needs to be implemented to support the labour market and/or GDP growth. Hawkish Case: A “wait and see” approach on the back of the assumed cut to see how the outlined macro measures feed through into housing and consumer spending. Elsewhere, the yield on 10-year Treasuries has eased -4 bps to +2.086%, hitting the lowest in about two-years, while the yield on two-year Treasuries has dipped -6 bps to +1.86%. In Germany, the 10-year Bund yield has fallen -1 bps to -0.21%, the lowest on record, while in Japan, the 10-year JGB yield has gained less than +1 bps to -0.093%. 4. Dollar direction to be dictated by week events Last week saw the USD index come under pressure as the Trade war remained the focal point. This week’s events do not change anything – President Trump is visiting the U.K and other events ranging from non-farm payroll (NFP), ISM releases and Fed Chair Powell speaking Tuesday are expected to influence direction. Also making it a tad more difficult for FX traders is the yield in the U.S 10 years reaching two-year lows and encroaching on the +2.05% handle. EUR/USD (€1.1176) trades within striking distance of the psychological €1.12 now that €1.11 handle held twice in the past fortnight. With BTP’s and Bund futures trade higher today as the markets continue their “risk-off” theme started a few weeks back. The ‘single’ unit is expected to remain quiet this week, at least until we will see the ECB rate decision on Thursday (07:45 am ET) with focus on the staff projections and any details on TLTRO-3. GBP/USD (£1.2640) trades above the £1.26 handle after briefly trading below last week. The U.K is hosting Trump for a three-day state visit and he is expected to meet with Boris Johnson, a favorite for the PM position. The pound was unmoved from this morning’s disappointing U.K PMI manufacturing data, which went into contraction for the first-time since the Jun 2016 Brexit Referendum. The Bank of England’s (BoE) Governor Carney is scheduled to speak Thursday, which could see some market moving comments. 5. UK Manufacturing PMI signals contraction Data this morning showed that the U.K manufacturing sector showed increased signs of renewed contraction last month. At 49.4, down sharply from 53.1 in April, the headline seasonally adjusted IHS Markit PMI fell below the neutral 50.0 benchmark for the first time in three-years. Digging deeper, manufacturers reported increased difficulties in convincing clients to commit to new contracts which mainly reflected the already high level of inventories following recent stockpiling activity in advance of the original Brexit date. The total volume of new business placed fell for the first time in seven-months, while the rate of contraction was the greatest and fastest in a number of years. New order inflows deteriorated from both domestic and overseas sources, while new export business fell for the second month running and at the quickest pace in nearly five years – manufacturers reported a lower demand from Asia and Europe. There was also mention of Brexit uncertainty, including clients diverting supply chains away from the U.K, leading to lower demand from within the E.U.

5e95735b3a94556e8b6fffec	Lockdowns are being extended: The more pain now, the quicker you can reopen the economy	After rallying into the Easter weekend, European markets were bit lacklustre on Tuesday but still trading marginally higher thanks to some decent numbers out of China and the continued hope that governments are getting a grip of the crisis. US shares closed softer on Monday, with the S&P 500 down 1%, but this was after the best weekly rally for Wall Street since 1974. Asian shares rallied overnight after better-than-expected Chinese trade data. Exports fell 6.6% in March, against –14% expected. Imports slipped 0.9% vs –9.5% forecast. With the usual caveats around Chinese government data, these numbers are much better than feared and underpinned broad strength in Asian trade. The Nikkei 225 closed 3% higher, finishing at a one-month high, while shares across China were also up around the 1% mark for the day. US futures are trading higher. Lockdowns are being extended: The bitterer the pill, the stronger the medicine. At least that is what many governments are hoping for as they extend lockdowns and seek a path out of the mess. France will only gradually begin reopening the country from May 11th, while India's lockdown is being extended through to May 3rd. The UK seems set to extend the lockdown by another 3 weeks to May 7th. The hope is that the more pain now, the quicker you can reopen the economy. We'll need it – France's finance minister Le Maire says GDP will decline 8% in 2020. Meanwhile in the US, Donald Trump is as belligerent as ever, saying he is working on plans to reopen the economy, despite being the global epicentre of the outbreak and deaths exceeding 22,000. Several state governors are taking steps on their own to do this. The risk lies, as everyone knows, in reopening too soon and needing to close down again. But if the US economy does get moving sooner than elsewhere, we could see stocks outperform too. Earnings season kicks off today in the US with the big banks. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo get the show on the road. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley report on Wednesday. Investors seem to be expecting heightened volatility around this quarter's earnings releases, reflecting the deep uncertainty about how bad the numbers will be. Heightened volatility will undoubtedly support trading top line, but we will need to see what effect government support has had on things like impairment charges. And as ever, the real focus will be on the earnings outlook for Q2. Despite the historic OPEC++ deal to cut output by 9.7m bpd over the next two months and commit to ongoing curbs for two years, WTI has slipped lower since reopening on Monday and is forming a support zone around $22.30/40. Brent is struggling to hold $32. There is still a lot uncertainty over whether the reduction in output will be enough. Saudi energy minister Abdulaziz Bin Salman said it will be more than the 9.7m headline cut, indicating as much as 19.5m bpd will come out of the market initially. But the commitment still lacks what some think could be a demand crash worth 30m bpd. Whilst there is bound to be a rebalancing in oil markets due to supply coming off, either by design or by default, most think OPEC and allies haven't done enough to prop up prices in the near term, albeit they do seem to have shown a willingness to prevent a complete collapse as inventory builds threatened to overwhelm the market. Output in North America is already collapsing. The EIA sees output down 366k bpd in April to 8.71m bpd and a further drop in May to 8.53m bpd. It wasn't' long ago US output was around 13m bpd. In Canada the number of active rigs has declined to just 35 from as many as 240 in February. Bank of America says the deal by OPEC will stem the decline in the US – just 1.8m bpd being lost vs a 3.5m without the deal. It predicts demand for 2020 will be down 9.2m bpd, vs a prior estimate of 4.4m. Texas oil regulators could decide today to mandate 20% production cuts. The biggest uncertainty for oil is how quickly does demand recover in the medium term? Indeed, this is the central question for risk assets in general. In FX, the pound pushed up to its strongest in a month versus the US dollar. GBPUSD broke clear of the month range yesterday and continues to find near term support above 1.2530.
